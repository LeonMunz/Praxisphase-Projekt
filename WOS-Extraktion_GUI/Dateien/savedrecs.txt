Light and temperature acclimation balance photosynthetic processes in a complex interplay with the fluctuating environment. However, due to limitations in the measurements techniques, these acclimations are often described under steady-state conditions leading to inaccurate photosynthesis estimates in the field. Here we analyze the photosynthetic interaction with the fluctuating environment and canopy architecture over two seasons using a fully automated phenotyping system. We acquired over 700,000 chlorophyll fluorescence transients and spectral measurements under semi-field conditions in four crop species including 28 genotypes. As expected, the quantum efficiency of the photosystem II (F-v/F-m in the dark and F-q'/F-m' in the light) was determined by light intensity. It was further significantly affected by spectral indices representing canopy structure effects. In contrast, a newly established parameter, monitoring the efficiency of electron transport (F-r2/F-v in the dark respective F-r2'/F-q' in the light), was highly responsive to temperature (R-2 up to 0.75). This parameter decreased with temperature and enabled the detection of cold tolerant species and genotypes. We demonstrated the ability to capture and model the dynamic photosynthesis response to the environment over entire growth seasons. The improved linkage of photosynthetic performance to canopy structure, temperature and cold tolerance offers great potential for plant breeding and crop growth modeling.

Changes at the surface affect both the circulation and the precipitation. The magnitude depends on the model used, the irrigation description and the water amount, as well as the region. The study focuses on northern Italy (the Po Valley) due to its vulnerability to heatwaves and dependency on local water sources. This study is performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and newly developed irrigation parameterizations defined by different evaporative processes. The model runs at a 3 km convection-permitting resolution, starting in May 2015 and analyzing July. An irrigation amount of 5.7 mm is applied daily at 5 UTC for 3 h, starting from May 15. A set of convection-parameterized sensitivity simulations is used to investigate the results' dependency on timing. Using a convection-parameterized set of experiments, it is assessed that irrigation increases the precipitation accumulated over the region. While irrigation modifies the air mass properties, convection-permitting runs show that afternoon events are inhibited due to an increase in convection inhibition and decrease in boundary layer height. This happens despite the increase in the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and a decrease in both the lifting condensation level and level of free convection. For the nighttime event, irrigation increases significantly both boundary layer moisture and CAPE, increasing the precipitation. All cases are compared against the national radar composite accumulated over two hours, finding that the irrigated runs perform better than the control.

Two strategies to improve the oxidation resistance of the HfC/SiC ceramics are proposed. First concept involves the incorporation of a small amount of boron (ca. 0.6 wt.%) into the nanocomposite via a single-source-precursor approach, which contributes significantly to the enhancement of its oxidation resistance. Parabolic oxidation rate constants of 10(-3) to 10(-4) mg2/(cm(4) h) at 1300 - 1500 degrees C were measured for SHBC and were several orders of magnitude lower than those recorded for boron-free HfC/SiC. The second improvement concept is realized via passivation of the samples upon short-term oxidation at 1400 degrees C, providing an excellent oxidation resistance over a wide temperature range. This is a crucial step especially when considering the poor oxidation behavior of HfC and the sluggish formation of protective silica scale at moderate temperatures.

The results show that although both Airbnb and hotel supply adversely affect hotel revenues (i.e., RevPAR), the magnitude of the impact of hotel supply on RevPAR is much larger than that of Airbnb. Airbnb adversely affects hotel room prices (i.e., ADR), however; it does not affect occupancy rates (i.e., OCC). Yet, increasing hotel supply negatively affects OCC but not ADR. The results from the state-level analyses further showed that the negative effects of Airbnb and hotel supply on RevPAR, ADR and OCC persist only in states with high hotel supply. Analyzing the joint effects of Airbnb and hotel supply on hotel performance in a manner that is both geographically-comprehensive and spatially-meaningful, this study provides a more complete and nuanced understanding on the economic dynamics of the accommodation industry.

To be able to study the effect of aeration on aroma release systematically in the future, a temperature study was conducted on an in vitro model built to study aroma release at temperatures relevant for oral processing. The studied dairy foam contained 4% (w/w) milk protein and 0.75% (w/w) alginate and had a gas volume fraction of 71% after whipping. The temperature development during incubation of the foam at 40 degrees C was calculated using a numeric simulation. Thermal equilibrium was reached after 50 min. Sampling for dynamic aroma release was found to be ideal at 2, 7 and 15 min, because mean foam temperatures were 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Experimental temperature analysis of the foam core was in good agreement with the simulation (R-2 = 0.95).	[Thomas, Christine F.; Thienel, Katharina J.

It can be regarded as a free group analogue of the group Lambda(n) of integral lower-triangular matrices. We call A(n)(+) the lower-triangular automorphism group of a free group. The first aim of the paper is to give a finite presentation for A(n)(+). The abelianization of the free group induces the surjective homomorphism rho(+) from A(n)(+) to Lambda(n). In our previous paper [18], we introduced the lower-triangular IA-automorphism group IA(n)(+). Here we show that IA(n)(+) coincides with the kernel of rho+. The second aim of the paper is to give an infinite presentation for IA(n)(+). Finally, we study a relation of the second homology groups between A(n)(+) and Lambda(n). In particular, we compute the second homology group H-2(Lambda(n), L) by using Magnus's presentation where L is a principal ideal domain in which 2 is invertible. For example, L = Q, Z/pZ for prime p >= 3. This gives a lower bound on the integral second homology group of A(n)(+). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kawai, T				Kawai, Tatsuji			Presenting de Groot duality of stably compact spaces	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Stably compact space; De Groot duality; Strong proximity lattice; Entailment relation; Locale	SYSTEMS	We give a constructive account of the de Groot duality of stably compact spaces in the setting of strong proximity lattice, a point-free representation of a stably compact space. To this end, we introduce a notion of strong continuous entailment relation, which can be thought of as a presentation of a strong proximity lattice by generators and relations. The new notion allows us to identify de Groot duals of stably compact spaces by analysing the duals of their presentations. We carry out a number of constructions on strong proximity lattices using strong continuous entailment relations and study their de Groot duals. The examples include various powerlocales, patch topology, and the space of valuations. These examples illustrate the simplicity of our approach by which we can reason about the de Groot duality of stably compact spaces. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Debates Male Incontinence DOMINO P	The impact of perioperative complications on favorable outcomes after artificial urinary sphincter implantation for post-prostatectomy incontinence	INTERNATIONAL BRAZ J UROL			English	Article						Urinary Incontinence; Stress; Urinary Sphincter; Artificial; Quality of Life	RISK-FACTORS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; EAU GUIDELINES; MALE SLINGS; EFFICACY; QUALITY; EROSION; SAFETY	Objective: To investigate the effect of perioperative complications involving artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation on rates of explantation and continence as well as health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Materials and methods: Inclusion criteria encompassed non-neurogenic, moderate-to-severe stress urinary incontinence (SUI) post radical prostatectomy and primary implantation of an AUS performed by a high-volume surgeon (>100 previous implantations). Reporting complications followed the validated Clavien-Dindo scale and Martin criteria. HRQOL was assessed by the validated IQOL score, continence by the validated ICIQ-SF score. Statistical analysis included Chi (2) test, Mann-Whitney-U test, and multivariate regression models (p<0.05). Results: 105 patients from 5 centers met the inclusion criteria. After a median follow-up of 38 months, explantation rates were 27.6% with a continence rate of 48.4%. In the age-adjusted multivariate analysis, perioperative urinary tract infection was confirmed as an independent predictor of postoperative explantation rates [OR 24.28, 95% CI 2.81-209.77, p=0.004). Salvage implantation (OR 0.114, 95% CI 0.02-0.67, p=0.016) and non-prostatectomy related incontinence (OR 0.104, 95% CI 0.02-0.74, p=0.023) were independent predictors for worse continence outcomes. Low visual analogue scale scores (OR 9.999, 95% CI 1,42-70.25, p=0.021) and ICIQ-SF scores, respectively (OR 0.674, 95% CI 0.51-0.88, p=0.004) were independent predictors for increased HRQOL outcomes. Perioperative complications did not significantly impact on continence and HRQOL outcomes. Conclusion: Findings show postoperative infections adversely affect device survival after AUS implantation. However, if explantation can be avoided, the comparative long-term functional results and HRQOL outcomes are similar between patients with or without perioperative complications.

These include Aldrin, Dieldrin, Endosulfan, Endrin, Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), Heptachlor, Heptachlorepoxide, Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), Isodrin, Methoxychlor, Mirex and Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). A total of 108 soil samples were collected in the wetland area, both extracted and eluted with cyclohexane and analysed by GC-MS. The results indicated that DDT isomers and degradation products were major POPs and were detected in 44 samples (40%). Their detection frequency followed the order of 4,4'-DDE > 4,4' -DDT > 4,4' -DDD > 2,4' -DDT > 2,4' -DDD and 2,4' -DDE. Residues varied from non-detected (nd) to 120 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (dw), with a mean value of 3.93 mu g kg-1 dw and a high variation (SD = 10.17 mu g kg(-1) dw). The degradation ratios confirmed both the historical and recent application of DDT and Dieldrin (0.53-18 mu g kg(-1) dw). Other detected POPs included PCBs in Kigali city which ranged from 0.1 to 0.21 mu g kg(-1) dw, confirming that the old contamination drifted from electric transformers. Aldrin (0.38-0.59 mu g kg(-1) dw); Heptachlor (0.14-0.19 mu g kg(-1) dw) residues probably reached the catchment through rain-washout. This study confirms that even though Rwanda banned the use of DDT and other POPs including pesticides (Aldrine, Chlordane, DDT, Dieldrine, Endrine, Heptachlor, Hexachlorobenzene, Mirex, and Toxaphene); Industrial products (Hexachlorobenzene and Polychlorobiphenyl PCBS) and unintentional sub-products, since 2002, some of above products are still used in random areas (e.g: DDT, Dieldrin). The highest residues were detected close to Lake Muhazi and areas surrounding Kigali city. This study recommends full evaluation of human health and ecological risks from exposure to DDT. Additionally, the National Implementation Plan (NIP) for the Stockholm Convention to eliminate POPs should be reinforcement through strengthening the market control and educational programs.

A limited understanding by farmers about the identity of plant diseases, transmission pathways and appropriate management methods is a key, but underexposed, problem. This study uses a sample of 260 farmers producing chili pepper in Bangladesh to elucidate their knowledge, perceptions and management methods regarding chili anthracnose-a fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum species. The results show that virtually all farmers had experienced typical symptoms of anthracnose disease and farmers reported average crop yield losses of 4%. Yet, only 22% of the farmers knew that this was a fungal disease and only 25% could tell how the disease spreads in the field. Farmers solely relied on chemical pesticides to control anthracnose, while the use of biopesticides, soil covers and crop rotations was negligible and only 7% of the farmers used labelled seed. A sound understanding of farmers of the crop diseases they face, their transmission pathways, and appropriate management methods is essential for establishing effective pest control. These results clearly show much room for improving chili productivity and the income and health of farmers, by building their capacity to deal with anthracnose disease.

Non-critical uranium accumulation in soils of German and Danish long-term fertilizer experiments	GEODERMA			English	Article						Long-term experiments; Phosphorus fertilizer; Phosphate rocks; Uranium accumulation rate; Agricultural soils	SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTION; PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZERS; TRACE-ELEMENTS; CADMIUM; GROUNDWATER; SPECIATION; MOUNTAINS; THORIUM; ORIGIN	Phosphorus (P) fertilizers vary considerably in contents of uranium (U), thus raising concerns regarding U accumulation in agricultural soils. We examined U concentrations in soil from three long-term field experiments with different P fertilizer applications: Rengen (P fertilizer from basic slag, grassland, Germany), Thyrow (P fertilizer from igneous phosphate rocks, arable land, Germany) and Askov (P fertilizer from igneous phosphate rocks, arable land, Denmark). Accumulation rates were low for Rengen (1.3 mu g U kg(-1) yr(-1)) and Thyrow (0.6 mu g U kg(-1) yr(-1)) in P-treated plots compared with plots without P fertilization. These accumulation rates were ten times lower than those previously reported (mean 17 mu g U kg(-1) yr(-1)). Intriguingly, concentrations of acidextractable U in the Askov topsoil increased from 1923 to 2016, regardless of whether P was added (5.1 mu g kg(-1) yr(-1)) or not (4.7 mu g kg(-1) yr(-1)). This suggests that at least part of the accumulated U originated from other sources than P fertilizers. Total U concentrations were significantly larger in the period 1985-2016 than in the period 1938-1976 in Askov soil treated with NPK but not in soils without P fertilization. Hence, long-term P fertilizer application did increase the soil U concentrations at Askov, although at a low level. The low U accumulation rates in soils from these German and Danish long-term P fertilization experiments indicate that with current management, the soil U concentration could remain at non-critical levels even on a centennial scale. This is attributed to the historic use of P fertilizers derived from sources with low U content (igneous phosphate rocks from Finland and Kola Peninsula for Askov and Thyrow, respectively, and basic slag for Rengen). Hence, U accumulation due to long-term P fertilization in agricultural soils may be alleviated by using phosphate rocks from low U sources in P fertilizer production.

Data-Driven Finite Elasticity	ARCHIVE FOR RATIONAL MECHANICS AND ANALYSIS			English	Article							DATA SCIENCE	We extend to finite elasticity the Data-Driven formulation of geometrically linear elasticity presented in Conti et al. (Arch Ration Mech Anal 229:79-123, 2018). The main focus of this paper concerns the formulation of a suitable framework in which the Data-Driven problem of finite elasticity is well-posed in the sense of existence of solutions. We confine attention to deformation gradients F is an element of Lp(omega & x37e;Rnxn)and first Piola-Kirchhoff stresses P is an element of Lq(omega & x37e;Rnxn) with (p,q)is an element of(1,infinity) and 1/p+1/q=1We assume that the material behavior is described by means of a material data set containing all the states (F, P) that can be attained by the material, and develop germane notions of coercivity and closedness of the material data set. Within this framework, we put forth conditions ensuring the existence of solutions. We exhibit specific examples of two- and three-dimensional material data sets that fit the present setting and are compatible with material frame indifference.

The uppermost Albian deposits consist of lignitic clay containing fossiliferous amber. The lowermost Cenomanian sand deposits alternate with clay intercalations containing plant remains. One of these clay levels, named P1, shows an outstanding accumulation of conifer and angiosperm macrofossils including delicate reproductive structures such as flowers. Plant remains are associated with invertebrates such as insects (Odonata, Dictyoptera, Diptera), crustaceans (Mecochirus sp.), putative brachiopods (aff. Lingula sp.), and worms. A few vertebrate remains such as shark egg capsules (Palaeoxyris sp.) and a feather are present in the fossil assemblage, as well as an enigmatic specimen tentatively interpreted as a cephalochordate or a petromyzontiform. Various ichnofossils occur in abundance, such as crustacean coprolites and burrows (Ophiomorpha isp.), insect coprolites (Microcarpolithes hexagonalis), and leaf herbivory, galls and mines. The sediments have been deposited in a coastal, calm and brackish area. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Perched water tables are linked to the presence of a low water-permeable soil horizon and high water input by precipitation. Precipitation, however, is strongly affected by climate change. Hence, we postulate that soils with a perched water table are particularly vulnerable to climate change. To verify this hypothesis, we set up a monitoring campaign from April 2014 to October 2019 at a forested Planosol in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. On an hourly basis, the redox potential (E-H) and airfilled pore volume (epsilon) were measured in four soil depths. Furthermore, we calculated the CWB and employed two future climate scenarios for the years 2071-2100 to discuss the consequences for RMF formation. Reducing conditions were evident in the moist hydrological winter of 2015 and 2016, while oxidizing soil conditions (E-H > 300 mV at pH 7) prevailed throughout the drier years (2017, 2018, 2019) for the whole soil profile. Concomitant with an increase in s during spring, we observed a switch from reducing to oxidizing soil conditions at low s of epsilon 0.01-0.03 cm(3) cm(-3) in the temporarily water-saturated soil horizons. At present, reducing soil conditions are limited during early spring during which manganese and iron can be mobilized from their oxides. Thus, RMF actively form but the CWB forecast until 2100 indicates a lower water input, which will diminish the period for redox-induced mineral dissolution. This study provided the essential information that soils with a perched water table are specifically vulnerable under progressing climate change. Presumably, RMF become more and more relictic that needs to be validated in the future.

Above- and below-ground biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of major land-use systems (i.e., exclosure, cropland, rangeland, and bare land) were quantified after field sampling along a topographic gradient. We found that aboveground carbon stocks peaked in the 15-year-old exclosures (9.08 +/- 1.44 Mg ha(-1)) owing to intact woody and grass vegetation as well as substantial litter cover ( > 20% of the total biomass). Croplands cultivated with wheat and rangelands vegetated with perennial grasses showed average aboveground carbon stocks of 3.16 +/- 0.24 and 1.45 +/- 0.19 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The belowground biomass carbon stock was particularly low in croplands (0.76 +/- 0.09 Mg ha(-1)), exceeded by that in both exclosures and rangelands, where values averaged 3.67 +/- 0.06 and 3.04 +/- 0.42 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The topsoil (0-30 cm) SOC stocks also varied with land-use systems but showed a different order, peaking in rangelands (53.9 +/- 10.1 Mg ha(-1)) and exclosures (41.4 +/- 8.1 Mg ha(-1)), followed by bare lands (29.0 +/- 11.5 Mg ha(-1)) and croplands (26.4 +/- 4.6 Mg ha(-1)). The sub-soils (30-100 cm) added 40% to this SOC storage. The greatest total SOC stock identified in exclosures that had been established primarily on degraded hillslopes may signify a successful restoration effort under the IWM program. However, croplands exhibited the lowest SOC stock, which implies the need for urgent interventions to improve the soil fertility.

Exposure to and application of high temperatures during production, processing and transport of these emulsifiers can induce compositional changes and thereby affect techno-functional properties. Emulsifiers were stored above their respective melting point and their chemical composition was determined by high-performance thin-layer chromatography-fluorescence detection. Storage for 8 weeks decreased the MAG content of a saturated MAG by about 36% by transesterification into 1,3-DAG, while a rearrangement of 1,2- into 1,3-DAG was observed for a saturated MAG/DAG emulsifier. Emulsifiers were applied to aerosol whipping cream, and viscosity, particle size, overrun, foam firmness and drainage were determined. The increasing 1,3-DAG content of the saturated MAG emulsifier was found to increase the drainage of aerosol whipping cream from 15% to 50%.

We show that under certain conditions the local law holds up to the optimal scale, i.e., the eigenvalue density on scales just above the eigenvalue spacing follows the global density of states which is determined by free probability theory. We prove that these conditions hold for general homogeneous polynomials of degree two and for symmetrized products of independent matrices with i.i. d. entries, thus establishing the optimal bulk local law for these classes of ensembles. In particular, we generalize a similar result of Anderson for anticommutator. For more general polynomials our conditions are effectively checkable numerically. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Favorable prognosis in pediatric brainstem low-grade glioma: Report from the German SIOP-LGG 2004 cohort	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						brainstem low grade glioma; child; surgery; chemotherapy; radiotherapy	CHILDREN; TUMORS; CHILDHOOD; MULTICENTER; ONCOLOGY; CHEMOTHERAPY; CARBOPLATIN; VINCRISTINE; MANAGEMENT; SOCIETY	Reports on pediatric low-grade glioma (LGG) of the caudal brainstem are retrospective with heterogeneous cohorts, variable treatments and inconsistent outcome data. We analyzed their natural history and asked whether brainstem location proved unfavorable for survival within the framework of the comprehensive SIOP-LGG 2004 management strategy. Within the prospectively registered, population-based German SIOP-LGG 2004 cohort 116 patients (age 0.2-16.5 years, 10% Neurofibromatosis NF1) were diagnosed with LGG of the pons (27%) and medulla oblongata (73%). After biopsy (23%), variable resection (63%) or radiologic diagnosis only (14%), 59 patients received no adjuvant treatment. Radiologic progression or severe neurologic symptoms prompted chemo- (n = 39) or radiotherapy (n = 18). After further progression (28/57), salvage treatments included multiple treatment lines for 12/28 patients. Five-years event-free survival dropped to 0.40, while 5-years overall survival was 0.95 (median observation time 6.8 years). Higher extent of resection yielded lower progression rate (p = 0.001), but at a cost of 21/100 patients suffering from new postsurgical complications including respiratory insufficiency. Central review confirmed pilocytic astrocytoma (56%), diffuse astrocytoma (8%) or glioneuronal histology (16%) (others 4%, no histology 17%). Malignant evolution was documented in five patients associated with Histone3 mutation in 2/5. Our treatment algorithm conveyed high overall survival for pediatric brainstem LGG. Extensive neurosurgical resection did increase additional postoperative neurologic deficits but not overall survival in this often-chronic disease. More than half of all patients can be safely followed by observation, while multimodal adjuvant treatment can control progressive tumors. Molecular assessment should confirm low-grade diagnosis and may detect patterns prognostic for malignant evolution.

J	Akyol, K				Akyol, Kemal			Stacking ensemble based deep neural networks modeling for effective epileptic seizure detection	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Epileptic seizure; Electroencephalography signals; Stacking approach; Deep neural networks; K-fold cross-validation; Performance improvement	EEG SIGNALS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM	Electroencephalography signals obtained from the brain's electrical activity are commonly used for the diagnosis of neurological diseases. These signals indicate the electrical activity in the brain and contain information about the brain. Epilepsy, one of the most important diseases in the brain, manifests itself as a result of abnormal pathological oscillating activity of a group of neurons in the brain. Automated systems that employed the electroencephalography signals are being developed for the assessment and diagnosis of epileptic seizures. The aim of this study is to focus on the effectiveness of stacking ensemble approach based model for predicting whether there is epileptic seizure or not. So, this study enables the readers and researchers to examine the proposed stacking ensemble model. The benchmark clinical dataset provided by Bonn University was used to assess the proposed model. Comparative experiments were conducted by utilizing the proposed model and the base deep neural networks model to show the effectiveness of the proposed model for seizure detection. Experiments show that the proposed model is proven to be competitive to base DNN model. The results indicate that the performance of the epileptic seizure detection by the stacking ensemble based deep neural networks model is high; especially the average accuracy value of 97.17%. Also, its average sensitivity with 93.11% is superior to the base DNN model. Thus, it can be said that the proposed model can be included in an expert system or decision support system. In this context, this system would be precious for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This model is developed from existing models for the prediction of retention times in temperature programmed GC. It is based on basic fluid mechanics of gasses in capillaries to describe the properties of the mobile phase and a thermodynamic model to describe retention of solutes in a stationary phase. This model is expanded to incorporate a spatial thermal gradient. The development of the peak width during the chromatographic separation is modeled by a differential equation, which uses the solute residency, the inverse of the solute velocity, instead of the solute velocity. The presented model is compared to measurements of n-alkanes with conventional temperature programmed GC-FID and to measurements with a hyper-fast flow-field thermal gradient GC (FF-TG-GC) coupled with a MS. The FF-TG-GC enables the use of a spatial thermal gradients. For temperature programmed GC-FID, without spatial thermal gradients, calculated retention times are mostly within 1% of measured values. For the FF-TG-GC-MS with a thermal gradient the simulation showed a deviation of the spatial thermal gradient from a linear to a nonlinear gradient, which could be confirmed by measuring the shape of the spatial gradient. The calculated retention times for the nonlinear gradient are also mostly within 1% of measured values. Calculated peak widths are smaller than measured peak widths by 10 to 15% in the case of the conventional GC-FID and by 30 to 50% for the FF-TG-GC-MS. The relation between the measured and calculated variances shows a linear correlation which can be used to correct the calculated variance and peak width. With this correction the difference for the peak widths is reduced to 4-10% for the conventional GC and below 10% for the majority of solutes with exceptions for early and late eluted n-alkanes (up to 25% difference).

Past studies provide basic evidence for increasing electricity consumption of cooling appliances with ageing but fail to investigate the associated technical wear. Concentrating on the degradation of the thermal insulation, we first determined the ageing process of sealed samples of polyurethane rigid foam by investigating changes in cell gas composition and thermal conductivity over time. Simultaneously, the main challenge was to develop an approach that investigates the age-related efficiency loss of the insulation without its destruction. This testing procedure is referred to as the Bonn method. The non-destructive Bonn method was applied to varying refrigerator models in a series of successive experiments to evaluate the insulation degradation over time. Subsequently, the physical relationship between the test value of the Bonn method and the heat transfer through the multi-layered compartment walls of domestic refrigeration appliances was established, ultimately characterising the degrading insulation in terms of increasing heat transfer. Our results give substantiated evidence that the efficiency loss of cooling appliances is greatly influenced by insulation degradation over time. The ageing of sealed samples of polyurethane rigid foam indicates a large initial increase of thermal conductivity by 15% within the first year, corresponding to a change in cell gas composition. These results are in line with those of the Bonn method, emphasising an increasing heat flow through the multi-layered compartment walls of domestic refrigerators with ageing. Therewith, the present study is of significance to a wide range of stakeholders and forms the basis for future research.

Cladribine has activity in AML, and an enhancing effect on other cytostatic drugs thus may help overcome resistance. Here, we present the final analysis of our phase II trial evaluating safety and efficacy of cladribine, cytarabine, and idarubicin (CAI) in relapsed AML. Methods Patients with relapsed AML after at least 6 months remission received two courses of CAI. After 9 patients, prolonged neutropenia prompted protocol change (omission of idarubicin in 2nd course and dose-reduction of cytarabine). Primary endpoints were remission rate and safety. Results Twenty patients received treatment, fourteen one, and six two courses CAI/CA. After first course, complete remission (CR/CRi) was achieved in 60%. Most frequent toxicity was infection. Median OS was 8.8 months in all patients and 21.1 months in those with CR. Nine patients (48%) proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), four of those are still alive and in CR, accounting for a 5-year survival rate of 55% of transplanted patients. Conclusion Cladribine, cytarabine, and idarubicin in relapsed AML is feasible and induces good response rates. As expected, infections are the most important complication. However, combined with allo-SCT, long-term survival can be achieved in a substantial number of patients.

Research at Varian on applied superconductivity for proton therapy	SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						superconductors; medical accelerators; proton therapy; gantry; cyclotron; conduction cooling		Proton therapy is a rapidly increasing modality to treat cancerous tumors, but large-scale implementation, and therefore widespread availability for patients, is hindered by the size and upfront investment for treatment facilities. Superconducting technology can enable more compact, and therefore more affordable treatment systems, by increasing the magnetic field in the magnets for the proton accelerator (typically a cyclotron) and in the beam guidance up, over, and into the patient (the gantry). In this article, we discuss research at Varian Medical Systems Particle Therapy GmbH on various superconducting technologies for potential application in future, more compact cyclotrons and gantries. We discuss which technologies are feasible, and to what extent. We demonstrate why certain conductor choices are made, and show the development of novel new conductor and magnet technologies that will be required to enable the next generation of cryogen-free, conduction-cooled compact treatment systems. We conclude that superconductivity is certainly required for the next generation of proton treatment systems, but also that the amount of compactness that can eventually be achieved is not solely determined by the magnetic field strength that is generated in the magnets.

Recently, it emerges as an alternative approach for the rapid identification and development of new pharmaceuticals for various rare and complex diseases for which lack the effective drug treatments. The success rate of drugs repurposing approach accounts for approximately 30% of new FDA approved drugs and vaccines in recent years. This review focuses on the status of drugs repurposing approach for various diseases including skin diseases, infective, inflammatory, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Weed seedlings were determined every year in spring on a regular grid with 429 observation points (15 x 7.5 m; net study area = 4 ha). Dominant weed species were Chenopodium album, Polygonum aviculare, Viola arvensis and different grass weeds, clearly dominated by Alopecurus myosuroides. A non-invasive electromagnetic induction survey was conducted to evaluate available water capacity directly in the field at high spatial resolution. Further soil properties were evaluated following the minimum-invasive approach with soil sampling and subsequent mid-infrared spectroscopy. Plant available nutrients were analysed with conventional lab methods. Redundancy analysis served to describe the effect of soil properties, different years and field crops on weed species variability. Seven soil properties together explained 30.7% of the spatial weed species variability, whereas 28.2% was explained by soil texture, available water capacity and soil organic carbon. Maps for site-specific weed management were created based on soil maps. These maps permit several benefits for precision crop protection, such as a better understanding of soil-weed inter-relations, improved sampling strategies and reduction in herbicide use.

For the discretization of the state equation we use linear finite elements and for the control discretization we analyze two strategies. First, we use variational discretization of the control and show that the L-2 - and L-1-error for the state and the adjoint state are of order O(h(2)) and that the L-1-error of the control behaves like O(h(2)), too. These results rely on a structural assumption that implies that the optimal control of the original problem is piecewise constant and that the adjoint state has nonvanishing first derivative at the jump points of the control. If, second, piecewise constant control discretization is used, we obtain L-2-error estimates of order O (h) for the state and W-1,W-infinity-error estimates of order O(h) for the adjoint state. Under the same structural assumption as before we derive an L-1-error estimate of order O(h) for the control. We discuss optimization algorithms and provide numerical results for both discretization schemes indicating that the error estimates are optimal.

TOURISM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Airbnb; Airbnb supply; Multi-unit hosts; Airbnb market share; Hotels		Research on Airbnb has provided significant evidence that it has an adverse impact on hotel performance. However, the impact of a more recent Airbnb-related phenomenon that remains under-explored is the increasing professionalization of Airbnb and the prevalence of multi-cubit hosts who offer more than one listing on the platform and are typically more dynamic in terms of issues like managing inventory and providing more standardized experiences. This professionalization begs the question of whether Airbnb should be considered a sharing economy platform or a lodging corporation (Airbnb 2.0). To answer this question, the present study identifies which types of Airbnb properties (entire homes, private rooms, or shared rooms) and host structures (single- or multi-unit hosts) are the biggest threats to traditional lodging companies in the U.S., and which states are most affected by the presence of Airbnb. The findings have significant implications for researchers and many practitioners associated with the phenomenon.

Here the scalar variable u stands for latitudinal angle on from the north pole to the south pole . The integer corresponds to the eigenvalues associated to eigenmaps , that is, harmonic maps with constant energy density. We prove constructively the existence of asymptotically non-self-similar blow-up solutions with precise description of their local space-time profiles. The blow-up solutions arise from, depending on the combination of d and k, two different approximations of the nonlinear term: either through a Dirac mass supported at the origin or via a Taylor expansion around equator map . Transition of the blow-up mechanisms arises, accordingly.

Cause-specific mortality after diagnosis of cancer among HIV-positive patients: A collaborative analysis of cohort studies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						PLHIV; cohort; mortality; cancer; ADM; NADM	ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; INFECTED INDIVIDUALS; RISK-FACTORS; SURVIVAL; AIDS; TRENDS; COMBINATION; HIV/AIDS	People living with HIV (PLHIV) are more likely than the general population to develop AIDS-defining malignancies (ADMs) and several non-ADMs (NADMs). Information is lacking on survival outcomes and cause-specific mortality after cancer diagnosis among PLHIV. We investigated causes of death within 5 years of cancer diagnosis in PLHIV enrolled in European and North American HIV cohorts starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) 1996-2015, aged >= 16 years, and subsequently diagnosed with cancer. Cancers were grouped: ADMs, viral NADMs and nonviral NADMs. We calculated cause-specific mortality rates (MR) after diagnosis of specific cancers and compared 5-year survival with the UK and France general populations. Among 83,856 PLHIV there were 4,436 cancer diagnoses. Of 603 deaths after ADM diagnosis, 292 (48%) were due to an ADM. There were 467/847 (55%) and 74/189 (39%) deaths that were due to an NADM after nonviral and viral NADM diagnoses, respectively. MR were higher for diagnoses between 1996 and 2005 versus 2006-2015: ADMs 102 (95% CI 92-113) per 1,000 years versus 88 (78-100), viral NADMs 134 (106-169) versus 111 (93-133) and nonviral NADMs 264 (232-300) versus 226 (206-248). Estimated 5-year survival for PLHIV diagnosed with liver (29% [19-39%]), lung (18% [13-23%]) and cervical (75% [63-84%]) cancer was similar to general populations. Survival after Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis was lower in PLHIV (75% [67-81%]). Among ART-treated PLHIV diagnosed with cancer, MR and causes of death varied by cancer type, with mortality highest for liver and lung cancers. Deaths within 5 years of NADM diagnoses were more likely to be from cancer than AIDS.	[Trickey, Adam; May, Margaret T.; Sterne, Jonathan A.

Variability of spider spatial configuration at the Martian south pole	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							SUBLIMATION-DRIVEN ACTIVITY; GROUND ICE; CO2 ICE; HIRISE OBSERVATIONS; THERMAL INERTIA; GRAIN-SIZE; NATURAL-CONVECTION; NEAR-SURFACE; MARS-ODYSSEY; WATER ICE	Araneiform terrain, or "spider" (spider-like surface modifications) is suggested to form through basal sublimation of seasonal translucent CO2 slab ice and subsequent gas jetting, and so far only known to occur at the Martian south pole. Their spatial configuration characteristics remain incompletely understood. We observed non-random spatial distributions in seven study regions with significant regional variation of average spacings. This non-randomness results from the pressure release by jetting from one spider, inhibiting ice rupture in the vicinity to initiate a new spider. Rose diagrams constructed from our trough orientation mapping show that spider troughs do not have preferred orientations and appear randomly distributed. We suggest that substrate properties such as permeability, porosity and cohesion regulate and modify the spatial configuration of a spider population on a regional scale, and insolation and obliquity determine whether general conditions are favorable for spider formation. The limited areal distribution of spiders may be due to the strict formation constraints on the thickness of the seasonal translucent CO2 slab ice. This work provides insight into the regional variability of gas jetting and spider formation.	[Hao, J.; Michael, G.

J	de Melo, J; Solleder, JM				de Melo, Jaime; Solleder, Jean-Marc			Barriers to trade in environmental goods: How important they are and what should developing countries expect from their removal	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Environmental goods; WTO; Trade and environment	LOG	Few developing countries have participated in the environmental goods agreement (EGA) negotiations to reduce barriers on trade in Environmental Goods (EGs). Reasons for this reluctance are first reviewed along with a comprehensive description of barriers to trade (tariffs and NTBs) on two lists of EGs used in negotiations: the APEC list comprising mostly industrial products representative of high-income countries that served as point of departure on the negotiations for an Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) and a list of Environmentally Preferable Products (EPPs) more representative of the perceived interests of developing countries. The paper then revisits and extends the literature on the estimation of barriers to trade in EGs for these lists. These estimates are carried out with a structural gravity model with: (i) new data on bilateral (rather than MFN) tariffs, and a new classification of NTBs; (ii) a measure of regulatory overlap in bilateral trade. Results show that tariffs reduce the intensity of bilateral trade. Regulatory harmonization, as captured by an increase in regulatory overlap is also estimated to be conducive to more intense bilateral trade. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper uses a variety of tests to detect structural breaks in the time series for violence over the period 1998-2017. We identify a transition from a high violence regime to a low violence regime that coincides with (i) the fencing of the border with Pakistan (ii) the implementation of a large-scale development program, and (iii) the phasing in of the Indian National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). Panel data analysis using district-level data further corroborate these findings. Our results highlight the complementary roles of development programs and security in reducing violence.

We investigated metaphors expressed either only in coverbal gestures (monomodal metaphors) or in speech with accompanying gestures ("multimodal metaphors"). Monomodal metaphoric gestures convey metaphoric information not expressed in the accompanying speech (e.g. saying the non-metaphoric utterance, "She felt bad" while dropping down the hand with palm facing up; here, the gesture alone indicates metaphoricity), whereas coverbal gestures in multimodal metaphors indicate metaphoricity redundant to the speech (e.g. saying the metaphoric utterance, "Her spirits fell" while dropping the hand with palm facing up). In other words, in monomodal metaphors, gestures add information not spoken, whereas the gestures in multimodal metaphors can be redundant to the spoken content. Understanding and integrating the information in each modality, here spoken and visual, is important in multimodal communication, but most prior studies have only considered multimodal metaphors where the gesture is redundant to what is spoken. Our participants watched audiovisual clips of an actor speaking while gesturing. We found that abstract metaphor comprehension recruited the lateral superior/middle temporal cortices, regardless of the modality in which the conceptual metaphor is expressed. These results suggest that abstract metaphors, regardless of modality, involve resources implicated in general semantic processing and are consistent with the role of these areas in supramodal semantic processing as well as the theory of embodied cognition.

J	Rubio, K; Castillo-Negrete, R; Barreto, G				Rubio, Karla; Castillo-Negrete, Rafael; Barreto, Guillermo			Non-coding RNAs and nuclear architecture during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis	CELLULAR SIGNALLING			English	Article							CHROMATIN TEXTURE ANALYSIS; GENE-EXPRESSION SIGNATURE; CIRCULATING TUMOR-CELLS; NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP; MESSENGER-RNA; RIBOSOMAL-SUBUNIT; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; MATURE MICRORNAS; PROMOTES EMT; DNA-DAMAGE	Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. On the other hand, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common interstitial lung disease showing a prevalence of 20 new cases per 100,000 persons per year. Despite differences in cellular origin and pathological phenotypes, LC and IPF are lung diseases that share common features, including hyperproliferation of specific cell types in the lung, involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced activity of signaling pathways, such as tissue growth factor (TGFB), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), wingless secreted glycoprotein (W NT) signaling, among others. EMT is a process during which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion, and acquire migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal cells. EMT involves numerous morphological hallmarks of hyperproliferative diseases, like cell plasticity, resistance to apoptosis, dedifferentiation and proliferation, thereby playing a central role during organ fibrosis and cancer progression. EMT was considered as an "all-or-none" process. In contrast to these outdated dichotomist interpretations, recent reports suggest that EMT occurs gradually involving different epithelial cell intermediate states with mesenchyme-like characteristics. These cell intermediate states of EMT differ from each other in their cell plasticity, invasiveness and metastatic potential, which in turn are induced by signals from their microenvironment. EMT is regulated by several transcription factors (TFs), which are members of prominent families of master regulators of transcription. In addition, there is increasing evidence for the important contribution of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) to EMT. In our review we highlight articles dissecting the function of different ncRNAs subtypes and nuclear architecture in cell intermediate states of EMT, as well as their involvement in LC and IPF.

Unfortunately, the prospects of analysis across different open budget data remain limited due to schematic and linguistic differences. Budget and spending datasets are published together with descriptive classifications. Various public administrations typically publish the classifications and concepts in their regional languages. These classifications can be exploited to perform a more in-depth analysis, such as comparing similar items across different, cross-lingual datasets. However, in order to enable such analysis, a mapping across the multilingual classifications of datasets is required. In this paper, we present the framework for Interlinking of Heterogeneous Multilingual Open Fiscal DaTA (IOTA). IOTA makes use of machine translation followed by string similarities to map concepts across different datasets. To the best of our knowledge, IOTA is the first framework to offer scalable implementation of string similarity using distributed computing. The results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed multilingual matching, the scalability of the proposed framework, and an in-depth comparison of string similarity measures.

Comparatively little is known about the relationship between cognitive failure susceptibility as quantified by the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) and personality factors. We examined the relationships between the CFQ and the seven personality dimensions as assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Through regression analyses with out-of-sample prediction in two samples, we explained around 18% of the variance in cognitive failure from personality scores. We established the character trait self-directedness as the main inversely related predictor of everyday cognitive failure. High cognitive failure thus seems to reflect low levels of self-confidence, self-acceptance, and responsibility for ones own actions which are the key aspects of self-directedness. This result provides evidence for the previously stated 'complaint' hypothesis that cognitive failure results from a poor self-image rather than a vulnerability to stress.

An empirical investigation	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Vulnerability; Climate finance; Small island developing states; Panel corrected standard errors; Climate policy	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; AID; ADAPTATION; ALLOCATION; GOVERNANCE; CAPACITY; MODELS; POLICY	International climate funds play a key role in supporting the adaptation policies of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to climate change by reducing their vulnerability. The mechanism of contributions established at national level under the Paris Agreement of 2015 lays the foundations to help international donors better understand each country's climate needs. With this in mind, this paper aims to provide some policy suggestions emerging from the analysis of the impact some variables have on reducing vulnerability. To this end, we consider the vulnerability index of 33 SIDS countries in terms of adaptation and mitigation policies. Based on the data availability, we use the panel-corrected standard errors estimator in time span from 2010 to 2014, taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of vulnerability. Our findings display that foreign aid and social development variables are crucial to promoting adequate and balanced responses to climate change. Therefore, we can confirm the effectiveness of external funds in reducing vulnerability. Domestic resources alone do not appear able to help SIDS due to endogenous limits of countries beneficiaries. The approach proposed in this paper can be extended to other small countries which are not islands, as well as to islands that are not nations. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

(1993) is applied to predict geometric earing in cup drawing using a non-circular blank geometry. In order to validate the theoretical results, non-linear finite element simulations were carried out. It is observed that the predictions of the theoretical model are in close agreement with the results of the finite element simulations, even for unusual blank contours. Based on this confidence, the analytical earing model is paired with a simple iterative earing compensation procedure in order to calculate the blank contour which is required to obtain an earing-free cup. These results, in turn, are confronted with those obtained by means of the analytical earing compensation approach proposed by Engler et al. (2011). Very good agreement between both approaches is found. Practical applications of the analytical earing compensation approach involving anisotropic materials demonstrate its very good performance.

To this end, a reduced unconstrained optimization problem in terms of the control variable is formulated. Based on the reduced approach, we then derive an a posteriori error representation and mesh adaptivity for multiple quantities of interest. All quantities are combined to one, and then the dual-weighted residual (DWR) method is applied to this combined functional. Furthermore, the estimator allows for balancing the discretization error and the nonlinear iteration error. These developments allow us to formulate an adaptive solution strategy, which is finally substantiated with the help of several numerical examples. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Groundwater controls on colloidal transport in forest stream waters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Field flow fractionation; Nanoparticles; Phosphorus; Rainfall; Soil leachate	FIELD-FLOW FRACTIONATION; CONCENTRATION-DISCHARGE RELATIONSHIPS; IRON-RICH COLLOIDS; ORGANIC-MATTER; NATURAL COLLOIDS; TRACE-ELEMENTS; CRITICAL ZONE; ICP-MS; PHOSPHORUS; CARBON	Biogeochemical changes of whole catchments may, at least in part, be deduced from changes in stream water composition. We hypothesized that there are seasonal variations of natural nanoparticles (NNP; 1-100 nm) and fine colloids (<300 nm) in stream water, which differ in origin depending on catchment inflow parameters. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the annual dynamics of the elemental composition of NNP and fine colloids in multiple water compartments, namely in stream water, above and below canopy precipitation, groundwater and lateral subsurface flow from the Conventwald catchment, Germany. In doing so, we monitored meteorological and hydrological parameters, total element loads, and analyzed element concentrations of org C, Al, Si, P, Ca, Mn and Fe by Asymmetric Flow Field Flow Fractionation (AF(4)). The results showed that colloid element concentrations were < 5 mu mol/L. Up to an average of 55% (Fe) of total element concentrations were not truly dissolved but bound to NNP and fine colloids. The colloid patterns showed seasonal variability with highest loads in winter. The presence of groundwater-derived colloidal Ca in stream water showed that groundwater mainly fed the streams throughout the whole year. Overall, the results showed that different water compartments vary in the NNP and fine colloidal composition making them a suitable tool to identify the streams NNP and fine colloid sources. Given the completeness of the dataset with respect to NNP and fine colloids in multiple water compartments of a single forest watershed this study adds to the hitherto underexplored role of NNP and fine colloids in natural forest watersheds.

J	Engbert, A; Gruber, S; Plank, J				Engbert, Alexander; Gruber, Stefanie; Plank, Johann			The effect of alginates on the hydration of calcium aluminate cement	CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS			English	Article						Polysaccharide; Alginate; Calcium aluminate cement; Accelerator; Hydration; Calcium complexation	INTERCALATION	The hydration of calcium aluminate cement (CAC) in the presence of sodium alginate which is known to slightly retard Portland cement, was studied using heat flow calorimetry and mortar strength testing. Most surprisingly, addition of alginate resulted in an earlier occurrence of the maximal heat release as well as an increased early strength, thus confirming that in CAC alginate acts as accelerator. The thickening effect of alginate was effectively compensated using a superplasticizer while retaining its accelerating property. An investigation of the pore solution composition indicated that in the presence of alginate the concentration of calcium ions was reduced. Such effect normally causes retardation of cement hydration and should delay the formation of C-A-H phases. Apparently, the strong calcium ion complexing ability of alginate promotes the formation of C-A-H via e.g. a templating effect. A combined application of alginates and lithium salts presents a viable option to reduce the lithium consumption in CAC acceleration.

Some EPS cause ropiness which might be linked to specific physical and chemical EPS properties. EPS show a broad variety of chemical structures and, because analysis is rather complex, it is still a major challenge to establish structure-function relationships. The aim of this study was to produce EPS with different degree of ropiness, perform in-depth structural elucidations and relate this information to their behaviour in aqueous solutions. After cultivation of Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7919 and Lactococcus lactis LL-2A and subsequent EPS isolation, both EPS showed similar macromolecular properties, but pronounced differences in monosaccharide composition and glycosidic linkages. Our data suggests that mainly the side chains in the EPS from LL-2A might be responsible for a higher ropiness than that observed for EPS from DGCC7919.

Since the membranes suitable for this purpose are mainly utilized for demineralization processes, the specifications given by the manufacturer are insufficient for the prediction of the rejection of uncharged solutes. Nine membranes with a molecular weight cut-off between 150 and 1000 Da were investigated showing differences in their rejection of fructose at a transmembrane pressure difference Delta p(TM) of 1.0 MPa. These values were correlated with the root-mean-square roughness S-q and apparent pore size d(ap) determined by atomic force microscopy, while the determined contact angle Theta did not influence the rejection. Thereby, a correlation between membrane morphology and rejection behavior was established.

Based on the respective acids, E 472 emulsifiers are classified in several categories with acetic acid esters (ACETEM, E 472a), lactic acid esters (LACTEM, E 472b), citric acid esters (CITREM, E 472c), and monoand diacetyl tartaric acid esters (DATEM, E 472e) as the most prominent representatives. Besides fruit acid esters, E 472 emulsifiers mainly comprise MAG, DAG, triacylglycerols, free fatty acids, free fruit acids and free glycerol in different amounts. Here we present an innovative and sensitive method for the characterization of the composition of E 472 emulsifiers by high-performance thin-layer chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPTLC-FLD). For HPTLC-FLD, technical emulsifiers were simply dissolved and analyzed on HPTLC silica gel plates after a two-fold development and derivatization with primuline, enabling the easy characterization and direct visual comparison of the emulsifier pattern (fingerprint) through the fluorescent lipid components under UV 366 nm. Thus, the HPTLC-FLD fingerprint approach represents a simple tool for the comparison of different samples, batches and categories of E 472. Coupling of HPTLC to mass spectrometry moreover enabled the identification of constituents of interest. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although large populations were present over a vast area until recently, a decline of the population as a result of hunting, poaching, and habitat loss led to the IUCN classification of G. subgutturosa as "vulnerable." We examined genetic diversity, structure, and phylogeny of G. subgutturosa using mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences from 18 geographically distant populations in Iran. The median-joining network of cyt b haplotypes indicated that three clades of goitered gazelles can be distinguished: a Middle Eastern clade west of the Zagros Mountains (and connected to populations in Turkey and Iraq), a Central Iranian clade (with connection to Azerbaijan), and an Asiatic clade in northeastern Iran (with connection to Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and other Asian countries as far as northeastern China and Mongolia). Based on our results, we argue that Iran is the center of diversification of goitered gazelles, due to the presence of large mountain ranges and deserts that lead to the separation of populations. In accordance with previous morphological studies, we identified the Asiatic clade as the subspecies G. s. yarkandensis, and the other two clades as the nominate form G. s. subgutturosa. The new genetic information for goitered gazelles in Iran provides the basis for future national conservation programs of this species.

This has stimulated the new field of 'active matter' in recent years, which focuses on the physical aspects of propulsion mechanisms, and on motility-induced emergent collective behavior of a larger number of identical agents. The scale of agents ranges from nanomotors and microswimmers, to cells, fish, birds, and people. Inspired by biological microswimmers, various designs of autonomous synthetic nano-and micromachines have been proposed. Such machines provide the basis for multifunctional, highly responsive, intelligent (artificial) active materials, which exhibit emergent behavior and the ability to perform tasks in response to external stimuli. A major challenge for understanding and designing active matter is their inherent nonequilibrium nature due to persistent energy consumption, which invalidates equilibrium concepts such as free energy, detailed balance, and time-reversal symmetry. Unraveling, predicting, and controlling the behavior of active matter is a truly interdisciplinary endeavor at the interface of biology, chemistry, ecology, engineering, mathematics, and physics. The vast complexity of phenomena and mechanisms involved in the self-organization and dynamics of motile active matter comprises a major challenge. Hence, to advance, and eventually reach a comprehensive understanding, this important research area requires a concerted, synergetic approach of the various disciplines. The 2020 motile active matter roadmap of Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter addresses the current state of the art of the field and provides guidance for both students as well as established scientists in their efforts to advance this fascinating area.

In this study, based on our previous results, novel annelated pyrimido- and diazepino[2,1-f]purinedione derivatives were designed as dual-target-directed ligands combining A(2A) adenosine receptor (AR) antagonistic activity with blocking monoamine oxidase B. A library of 19 novel compounds was synthesized and biologically evaluated in radioligand binding studies at AR subtypes and for their ability to inhibit MAO-B. This allowed 9-(2-chloro-6-fluorobenzyl)-3-ethyl-1-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyrimido[2,1-f]purine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (13 e; K-i human A(2A)AR: 264 nM and IC50 human MAO-B: 243 nM) to be identified as the most potent dual-acting ligand from this series. ADMET parameters were estimated in vitro, and analysis of the structure-activity relationships was complemented by molecular-docking studies based on previously published X-ray structures of the protein targets. Such dual-acting ligands, by selectively blocking A(2A) AR, accompanied by the inhibition of dopamine metabolizing enzyme MAO-B, might provide symptomatic and neuroprotective effects in, among others, the treatment of Parkinson disease	[Kuder, Kamil J.; Zaluski, Michal; Schabikowski, Jakub; Latacz, Gniewomir; Olejarz-Maciej, Agnieszka; Jasko, Piotr; Doroz-Plonka, Agata; Kiec-Kononowicz, Katarzyna] Jagiellonian Univ, Coll Med, Dept Technol & Biotechnol Drugs, Medyczna 9, PL-30-688 Krakow, Poland; [Brockmann, Andreas; Mueller, Christa E.] Univ Bonn, Inst Pharmaceut, PharmaCtr Bonn, Pharmaceut Chem, Immenburg 4, D-53121 Bonn, Germany	Kuder, KJ (reprint author), Jagiellonian Univ, Coll Med, Dept Technol & Biotechnol Drugs, Medyczna 9, PL-30-688 Krakow, Poland.	kamil.kuder@uj.edu.pl	Olejarz-Maciej, Agnieszka/J-4192-2017; Muller, Christa E./C-7748-2014; Latacz, Gniewomir/T-9942-2018	Olejarz-Maciej, Agnieszka/0000-0002-1466-0742; Zaluski, Michal/0000-0002-7518-8103; Muller, Christa E./0000-0002-0013-6624; Latacz, Gniewomir/0000-0001-9247-2598	Jagiellonian University Medical College [N42/DBS/000041, N42/DBS/000039]; Polish National Science Center [DEC-2018/02/X/NZ7/00584, DEC-2016/23/N/NZ7/00475]			57	0	0	1	1	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1860-7179	1860-7187		CHEMMEDCHEM	ChemMedChem	MAY 6	2020	15	9					772	786		10.1002/cmdc.201900717			15	Chemistry, Medicinal; Pharmacology & Pharmacy	Pharmacology & Pharmacy	LJ8EM	WOS:000530393700007	32162782				2020-05-19

The common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) occupies almost the entire Northern Eurasia and includes viviparous and oviparous lineages, thus representing an excellent model for such studies. Using body length data for >10,000 individuals from 72 geographically distinct populations over the species' range, we analyzed how sex-specific adult body size and sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is associated with reproductive mode, lineage identity, and several climatic variables. Variation in male size was low and poorly explained by our predictors. In contrast, female size and SSD varied considerably, demonstrating significant effects of reproductive mode and particularly seasonality. Populations of the western oviparous lineage (northern Spain, south-western France) exhibited a smaller female size and less female-biased SSD than those of the western viviparous (France to Eastern Europe) and the eastern viviparous (Eastern Europe to Far East) lineages; this pattern persisted even after controlling for climatic effects. The phenotypic response to seasonality was complex: across the lineages, as well as within the eastern viviparous lineage, female size and SSD increase with increasing seasonality, whereas the western viviparous lineage followed the opposing trends. Altogether, viviparous populations seem to follow a saw-tooth geographic cline, which might reflect the nonmonotonic relationship of body size at maturity in females with the length of activity season. This relationship is predicted to arise in perennial ectotherms as a response to environmental constraints caused by seasonality of growth and reproduction. The SSD allometry followed the converse of Rensch's rule, a rare pattern for amniotes. Our results provide the first evidence of opposing body size-climate relationships in intraspecific units.

Genetic variants of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A genes are associated with disease presentation and outcome in primary sclerosing cholangitis	LIVER INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Early Access						primary sclerosing cholangitis; SNP variants; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A	BILE-ACIDS; UDP-GLUCURONOSYLTRANSFERASES; GILBERTS-SYNDROME; GUT MICROBIOTA; RISK; UGT1A; HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA; EXPRESSION; IDENTIFICATION; INFLAMMATION	Background and aims Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive cholestatic liver disease without a curative medical therapy. The human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 1A play a major role in the detoxification and elimination of bilirubin, bile acids and xenobiotics. Whether genetic UGT1A variants determine course and outcome of PSC has not yet been described. Methods A large cohort of German PSC patients with a long-term-follow-up was genotyped for UGT1A variants including UGT1A1*28, UGT1A3-66 T>C and UGT1A7 p.N129K/p.R131K using TaqMan 5'-nuclease assays. Results were correlated with clinical characteristics and transplant-free survival. Results About 331 patients with PSC were included in the study (69.9% male, mean age at diagnosis 32.6 years). Median transplant-free survival was 14.9 years. Patients with wild-type alleles of all three UGT1A genes had a longer transplant-free survival (17.2 vs. 14.4 years, P = .048) than patients carrying a homozygous or heterozygous SNP variant in at least one of the UGT1A1, UGT1A3 or UGT1A7 genes. Additionally, we found that patients carrying wild-type alleles of all three UGT1A genes had lower serum bilirubin (25 vs. 38 mu mol/L, P = .02) and serum cholesterol (195 vs. 223 mg/dL), P = .035) at first presentation. Furthermore, inflammatory bowel disease was found to be associated with wild-type UGT1A alleles (82.2% vs. 68.4%, P = .046). Conclusions This large cohort shows an association with single nucleotide polymorphisms of the UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT1A7 genes and outcome in PSC. Thus, UGT1A variants may represent a tool for the prognostic stratification of PSC patients and establish a link between disease progression and the regulation of detoxification by glucuronidation in PSC.

An AC is defined as a pair of structurally similar compounds with a large potency difference against a given target. In medicinal chemistry, ACs are of interest because they reveal small chemical changes with large potency effects, a concept referred to as structure-activity relationship (SAR) discontinuity. Computationally, ACs can be systematically identified, going far beyond individual compound series considered during lead optimization. Large-scale analysis of ACs has revealed characteristic features across many different compound activity classes. The way in which the molecular similarity and potency difference criteria have been addressed for defining ACs distinguishes between different generations of ACs and mirrors the evolution of the AC concept. We discuss different stages of this evolutionary path and highlight recent advances in AC research.

The unique features of kidney dendritic cells are also examined, as well as their role in various acute and chronic types of kidney disease. Dendritic cells (DCs) are chief inducers of adaptive immunity and regulate local inflammatory responses across the body. Together with macrophages, the other main type of mononuclear phagocyte, DCs constitute the most abundant component of the intrarenal immune system. This network of functionally specialized immune cells constantly surveys its microenvironment for signs of injury or infection, which trigger the initiation of an immune response. In the healthy kidney, DCs coordinate effective immune responses, for example, by recruiting neutrophils for bacterial clearance in pyelonephritis. The pro-inflammatory actions of DCs can, however, also contribute to tissue damage in various types of acute kidney injury and chronic glomerulonephritis, as DCs recruit and activate effector T cells, which release toxic mediators and maintain tubulointerstitial immune infiltrates. These actions are counterbalanced by DC subsets that promote the activation and maintenance of regulatory T cells to support resolution of the immune response and allow kidney repair. Several studies have investigated the multiple roles for DCs in kidney homeostasis and disease, but it has become clear that current tools and subset markers are not sufficient to accurately distinguish DCs from macrophages. Multidimensional transcriptomic analysis studies promise to improve mononuclear phagocyte classification and provide a clearer view of DC ontogeny and subsets.

We exploit a piecewise linear relationship between the previous wage and benefits in Finland to identify the causal effects of the benefit level by using a regression kink design. Although we only find weak evidence of an effect on the time to the next job, higher benefits decrease the time spent in part-time unemployment and thus result in more full-time unemployment. The re-employment probability and post-unemployment wage are also negatively affected. The results for the duration of the first post-unemployment job are not conclusive, but in total both employment and earnings in the two years following the beginning of the unemployment spell decrease with higher benefits.

Acute painful crisis is the most characteristic manifestation of the disease. In addition, many patients report chronic pain. As both acute and chronic pain severely diminish quality of life, adequate pain management is crucial. Recommendations for the treatment of acute painful crises are based on the World Health Organization analgesic ladder, which has been developed for cancer-related pain. Chronic pain can be treated with basic long-acting opioids and on-demand short-acting opioids. If patients show signs of neuropathic pain, administration of anticonvulsants, antidepressants or possibly ketamine should be considered.

Troponin I and creatine kinase activity increased during infection. Different reports showed that complicated malaria coincides with hypoxia in children. The obtained clinical data prompted us to further elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of cardiac involvement in human cardiac ventricular myocytes. Complicated malaria is the most common clinical presentation and might induce cardiac impairment by hypoxia. Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) is involved in hypoxia induced factor (HIF-1 alpha) expression. EIF-5A is a protein posttranslationally modified by hypusination involving catalysis of the two enzymes deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. Treatment of human cardiomyocytes with GC7, an inhibitor of DHS, catalyzing the first step in hypusine biosynthesis led to a decrease in proinflammatory and proapoptotic myocardial caspase-1 activity in comparison to untreated cardiomyocytes. This effect was even more pronounced after co-administration of GC7 and GPI from P. falciparum simulating the pathology of severe malaria. Moreover, in comparison to untreated and GC7-treated cardiomyocytes, co-administration of GC7 and GPI significantly decreased the release of cytochrome C and lactate from damaged mitochondria. In sum, coadministration of GC7 prevented cardiac damage driven by hypoxia in vitro. Our approach demonstrates the potential of the pharmacological inhibitor GC7 to ameliorate apoptosis in cardiomyocytes in an in vitro model simulating severe malaria. This regulatory mechanism is based on blocking EIF-5A hypusination.

With the advancement of digital recording and call analysis in bioacoustics, we redescribe the advertisement call of M. alipioi from a population close to its type locality, municipality of Urucuca, Bahia. Additionally, we describe the release call and provide morphometric data. The advertisement call of M. alipioi consists of a simple pulsatile structured call, which can be emitted alone or in a series of 4-9 calls. The mean call duration is 0.46 +/- 0.04 s (0.35-0.55 s) and dominant frequency ranges from 344.5 to 430.7 Hz (366.2 +/- 37.56 Hz). The release call of M. alipioi usually has a pulsatile spindle-shaped waveform with harmonics and sidebands in the spectrum. The mean call duration is 0.175 s +/- 0.067 (0.032-0.314 s) and dominant frequency ranges from 387.60 to 559.90 Hz (420.99 Hz +/- 30.63 Hz). Males (95.3 +/- 5.5 mm) and females (99.6 +/- 7.8 mm) do not differ in body length, although they present significant differences related to morphometric variables of the hind limbs. We provide new bioacoustical and morphometric data of M. alipioi from a population close to its type locality. This information can help future studies that aim to define the range of a species that is widely distributed in the Atlantic Forest.

Several groups have shown increased activation of the left medial temporal lobe (MTL) before and during spontaneous thoughts suggesting that the left MTL may play a crucial role in mind wandering. Due to its relevance for long-term memory, we further hypothesized that the left MTL is particularly involved in mind wandering towards the past. Accordingly, we predicted a reduced propensity to mind wander and less past-oriented mind wandering in patients with left MTL epilepsies. To this end, we experimentally investigated mind wandering in 89 in-patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation of their putative epileptic disorder. Patients performed a sustained attention to response task with embedded experience sampling probes aiming to assess occurrence, meta-awareness and temporal orientation (past/present/future) of mind-wandering episodes. We did not find significant differences in the propensity to mind wander between patient subgroups. However, the left MTL epilepsy subgroup showed significantly reduced past-oriented mind wandering compared to right MTL epilepsies, as well as a trend towards diminished past-oriented mind wandering compared to idiopathic epilepsies. Possibly due to compensatory mechanisms, the right MTL epilepsy subgroup showed significantly increased past-oriented mind wandering compared to extratemporal epilepsies and patients with syncopes. These behavioural findings point to a rejection of the hypothesis that the amount of time engaged in mind wandering crucially depends on the left MTL. However, our data do support the idea that the left MTL is particularly involved in mind wandering towards the past.

Since atoms are electrically neutral, a key ingredient is the generation of sufficiently strong artificial gauge fields. Here we theoretically investigate the synthetization of such fields for bosonic erbium atoms by phase imprinting with two counterpropagating optical Raman beams. Given the nonvanishing orbital angular momentum of the rare-earth atomic species erbium in the electronic ground state and the availability of narrow-line transitions, heating from photon scattering is expected to be lower than in atomic alkali-metal species. We give a parameter regime for which strong synthetic magnetic fields with good spatial homogeneity are predicted. We also estimate the size of the Laughlin gap expected from the s-wave contribution of the interactions for typical experimental parameters of a two-dimensional atomic erbium microcloud. Our analysis shows that cold rare-earth atomic ensembles are highly attractive candidate systems for experimental explorations of the fractional quantum Hall regime.

Our final expressions, however, differ from the ones derived by the JLab-Pisa group using time-ordered perturbation theory [Phys. Rev. C 93, 015501 (2016); 93, 049902(E) (2016); 95, 059901(E) (2017)]. In this paper we consider the box diagram contribution to the axial current and demonstrate that the results obtained using the two methods are unitary equivalent at the Fock-space level. We adjust the unitary phases by matching the corresponding two-pion exchange nucleon-nucleon potentials and rederive the box diagram contribution to the axial current operator following the approach of the JLab-Pisa group, thereby reproducing our original result. We provide a detailed information on the calculation of the box diagram including the relevant intermediate steps in order to facilitate a clarification of this disagreement.

Game theoretically, the sequentially rational outcomes (for non-positive conflict payoffs of the responder) coincide, but the large multiplicity of equilibrium outcomes of ultimatum games is avoided by Yes-No games. As Avrahami et al. (J Socio-Econ 47: 47-54, 2013) for the ultimatum game, we experimentally implemented 100-period plays of Yes-No games for newly and randomly rematched player pairs to test whether their observation of fast and nearly universal convergence to equal sharing depends on its equilibrium property. Will there be significant altruistic sanctioning, convergence to solution play, or cyclicity in behavior? There are two possible pie sizes which either only proposers or both players know. The dynamics of play differ fundamentally from the quick convergence to equal sharing for ultimatum games. There is neither convergence to equal sharing nor to equilibrium play, but persistent heterogeneity in offers and (non)acceptance. Some participants engage in game theoretically unpredicted sanctioning even in later periods.

MRI follow-up after magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound for non-invasive thalamotomy: the neuroradiologist's perspective	NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Magnetic resonance imaging; Essential tremor; Parkinson disease; High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation	VENTRAL INTERMEDIATE NUCLEUS; ESSENTIAL TREMOR; TRACTOGRAPHY; HEMORRHAGE; TRIAL	Purpose Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) systems are increasingly used to non-invasively treat tremor; consensus on imaging follow-up is poor in these patients. This study aims to elucidate how MRgFUS lesions evolve for a radiological readership with regard to clinical outcome. Methods MRgFUS-induced lesions and oedema were retrospectively evaluated based on DWI, SWI, T2-weighted and T1-weighted 3-T MRI data acquired 30 min and 3, 30 and 180 days after MRgFUS (n = 9 essential tremor, n = 1 Parkinson's patients). Lesions were assessed volumetrically, visually and by ADC measurements and compared with clinical effects using non-parametric testing. Results Thirty minutes after treatment, all lesions could be identified on T2-weighted images. Immediate oedema was rare (n = 1). Lesion volume as well as oedema reached a maximum on day 3 with a mean lesion size of 0.4 +/- 0.2 cm(3) and an oedema volume 3.7 +/- 1.2 times the lesion volume. On day 3, a distinct diffusion-restricted rim was noted that corresponded well with SWI. Lesion shrinkage after day 3 was observed in all sequences. Lesions were no longer detectable on DWI in n = 7/10, on T2-weighted images in n = 4/10 and on T1-weighted images in n = 4/10 on day 180. No infarcts or haemorrhage were observed. There was no correlation between lesion size and initial motor skill improvement (p = 0.99). Tremor reduction dynamics correlated strongly with lesion shrinkage between days 3 and 180 (p = 0.01, R = 0.76). Conclusion In conclusion, cerebral MRgFUS lesions variably shrink over months. SWI is the sequence of choice to identify lesions after 6 months. Lesion volume is arguably associated with intermediate-term outcome.

The elaborated ecostratigraphy shows significant patterns of species composition related to the succession of pedocomplexes and loess, respectively. Pedocomplexes included species that can be associated with high-grass to forest-steppe biomes, indicating increased humidity for these sections compared to the loess layers. In contrast, loess layers that relate to glacial periods are associated with gastropod species of semidesert environments with shrub- and shortgrass-steppes, indicating semiarid to arid conditions. Furthermore, the loess deposits do not show any evidence for cold-adapted gastropod species. Therefore, we suggest that average July temperatures in the study area were above 10 degrees C, even during periods of loess deposition. Consequently, we propose that the limiting factor for tree growth during glacial periods was aridity, rather than temperature. In addition, we observe environmental differences between the various glacial times, with our results indicating a trend towards steadily increasing aridity in Southern Caucasia across the Middle to Late Pleistocene.

However, the complex relationship between this signal and other photosynthesis-related processes restricts its interpretation under stress conditions. To address this issue, we conducted a field campaign by combining daily airborne and ground-based measurements of F (normalized to photosynthetically active radiation), reflectance and surface temperature and related the observed changes to stress-induced variations in photosynthesis. A lawn carpet was sprayed with different doses of the herbicide Dicuran. Canopy-level measurements of gross primary productivity indicated dosage-dependent inhibition of photosynthesis by the herbicide. Dosage-dependent changes in normalized F were also detected. After spraying, we first observed a rapid increase in normalized F and in the Photochemical Reflectance Index, possibly due to the blockage of electron transport by Dicuran and the resultant impairment of xanthophyll-mediated non-photochemical quenching. This initial increase was followed by a gradual decrease in both signals, which coincided with a decline in pigment-related reflectance indices. In parallel, we also detected a canopy temperature increase after the treatment. These results demonstrate the potential of using F coupled with relevant reflectance indices to estimate stress-induced changes in canopy photosynthesis.

Methods: A post-hoc analysis of the Phase IIIb, 6-month, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, COMRADE-B and COMRADE-C trials. Change over 6 months in retinal ischemia status (central avascular [CA] zone and peripheral nonperfusion [PNP]), mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the development of shunt vessels and neovascularization, and frequency of laser therapy were assessed in retinal vein occlusion (RVO) patients treated with either ranibizumab 0.5 mg PRN or single dexamethasone 0.7 mg implant, as per European labels, in the COMRADE-B (N = 244; ranibizumab, 126, dexamethasone, 118) or COMRADE-C (N = 243; ranibizumab, 124, dexamethasone, 119) trials. BCVA progression in ischemic vs. non-ischemic patients based on the ischemia assessment at month 6 was carried out. Results: Visual acuity (VA) gains from baseline to month 6 were higher with ranibizumab than with dexamethasone in both patients with central ischemia and those with peripheral retinal nonperfusion, independent of the type of RVO (branch or central). The presence of CA and PNP had a significant impact on VA gain over 6 months in CRVO patients (p < .0001), while there was no significant impact in BRVO. Ranibizumab was associated with less new ischemia than dexamethasone. Central RVO patients treated with dexamethasone received more laser treatments over the 6 months than those treated with ranibizumab, while there was no difference in the frequency of laser therapy between the branch RVO treatment groups. Conclusions: VA gain over six months in ranibizumab-treated RVO patients is not affected by ischemia, and is associated with less development of new ischemia during the first 6 months of treatment and equal or fewer laser treatments than dexamethasone implant.

There is a need for agnostic approaches aiding in the interpretation of ML models regardless of their complexity that is also applicable to deep neural network (DNN) architectures and model ensembles. To these ends, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methodology has recently been introduced. The SHAP approach enables the identification and prioritization of features that determine compound classification and activity prediction using any ML model. Herein, we further extend the evaluation of the SHAP methodology by investigating a variant for exact calculation of Shapley values for decision tree methods and systematically compare this variant in compound activity and potency value predictions with the model-independent SHAP method. Moreover, new applications of the SHAP analysis approach are presented including interpretation of DNN models for the generation of multi-target activity profiles and ensemble regression models for potency prediction.

It has already been shown that especially those methods can effectively compress screen content which are able to predict the probability distribution of next pixel values. This prediction is typically based on a kind of learning process. The predictor learns the relationship between probable pixel colours and surrounding texture. Recently, an effective method called 'soft context formation' (SCF) had been proposed which achieves much lower bitrates for images with less than 8 000 colours than other state-of-the-art compression schemes. This paper presents an enhanced version of SCF. The average lossless compression performance has increased by about 5% in application to images with less than 8 000 colours and about 10% for images with up to 90 000 colours. In comparison to FLIF, FP8v3, and HEVC (HM - 16.20 + SCM - 8.8), it achieves savings of about 33%, 4%, and 11% on average. The improvements compared to the original version result from various modifications. The largest contribution is achieved by the local estimation of the probability distribution for unpredictable colours in stage II of the compression scheme.

The proposed model with optimisation is known as WCA-EMD-WMKRVFLN. The tanh and wavelet kernel functions are contributing together to the effectiveness of the proposed model. The features generated from EMD in terms of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are modulated to find important statistical and entropy based features and these features in a reduced form are employed as inputs to the model to classify epileptic EEG signals. The presented approach is evaluated in terms of percentage correct classification accuracy (ACC), specificity and sensitivity using two datasets and is compared with different classifiers and state-of-the-art techniques. The highest accuracies of 99.69% (five-class) and 100% (three-class) achieved using the Bonn-University dataset and 99.0% ACC (two-class) achieved using the Bern-Barcelona dataset. The achieved results report that the presented approach is a promising approach for EEG signal classification and is superior to several state-of-the-art techniques and is highly comparable to many such techniques.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We investigated the prevalence and associations of VI and major eye diseases with CKD among 5,518 participants aged 40 years or older in the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. An estimated glomerular filtration rate of lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was defined as CKD. Corrected visual acuity of worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye was defined as VI. Major eye diseases, including any ocular disease, any objectively determined ocular disease, cataract surgery, any retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma were evaluated from questionnaire or retinal photographs using standardized grading protocols. RESULTS: The prevalence of VI and major eye diseases were approximately 2- to 7-fold higher in participants with CKD than in those without (all P < .05). After controlling for multiple confounders, the presence of CKD was associated with VI (odds ratio [OR]: 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-3.54), any ocular disease (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.22-2.22), any objectively determined ocular disease (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.06-2.19), any retinopathy (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.18-2.45), and DR (OR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.23-4.42). There was no association of CKD with cataract surgery, AMD, or glaucoma. A significant association between CKD and any ocular disease was observed among nondiabetic participants. The presence of CKD was closely related to VI and any retinopathy among diabetic participants. CONCLUSIONS: This nationally representative sample of the US population demonstrated high prevalence and strong associations of VI and major eye diseases with CKD, highlighting the importance of ocular screening among CKD patients and potential common pathogenesis underlying these conditions.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. METHODS: Thirty-five eyes of 20 patients (age range, 24.9-75.9 years) with genetically proven MIDD and demarcated RPE atrophy on serial fundus autofluorescence (AF) images were included. Lesion size and shape-descriptive parameters were longitudinally determined by 2 independent readers. A linear mixed-effect model was used to predict the lesion enlargement rate based on baseline variables. Sample size calculations were performed to model the power in a simulated interventional study. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 4.27 years. The mean progression rate of RPE atrophy was 2.33 mm(2)/year, revealing a dependence on baseline lesion size (+0.04 [0.02-0.07] mm(2)/year/mm(2), P < .001), which was absent after square root transformation. The fovea was preserved in the majority of patients during the observation time. In the case of foveal involvement, the loss of visual acuity lagged behind central RPE atrophy in AF images. Sex, age, and number of atrophic foci predicted future progression rates with a cross-validated mean absolute error of 0.13 mm/year and to reduce the required sample size for simulated interventional trials. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive RPE atrophy could be traced in all eyes using AF imaging. Shape-descriptive factors and patients' baseline characteristics had significant prognostic value, guiding appropriate subject selection and sample size in future interventional trial design.

J	Nong, D				Duy Nong			Development of the electricity-environmental policy CGE model (GTAP-E-PowerS): A case of the carbon tax in South Africa	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						South Africa; Environmental policy; Climate change policy; Carbon tax; Computable general equilibrium (CGE); GTAP-E-PowerS	EMISSIONS REDUCTION FUND; TRADING SCHEME; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; ECONOMY; AUSTRALIA; PERFORMANCE; CONTEXT; CHINA	A new carbon price mechanism with full emission coverage is developed within the framework of a global computable general equilibrium model (GTAP-E-PowerS) to enhance the capacity and accuracy for climate change and energy policy assessment. The model developed is then used to examine the potential impacts of the carbon tax in South Africa. Results show that incorporation of non-CO2 emissions in the model significantly alters the results of which the economy of South Africa experiences higher costs compared to the case that only has CO2 emissions. When more sectors are included in the policy it also puts higher costs on the economy, as higher levels of emissions are subject to the carbon tax. Results also show that South Africa only experiences small tradeoffs from introducing the carbon tax in all scenarios. That is, with a tax rate of $9.15, the country is able to reduce its emission levels by 12.25%-15.6% at the costs of real GDP reduction by 1.17%-1.59%. Fossil-based industrial sectors are particularly worst off, while clean and renewable energy sectors strongly expand their production. The results indicate that South Africa is likely to move to a low carbon and sustainable economy with such a policy.

J	Nong, D; Nguyen, TH; Wang, C; Khuc, QV				Duy Nong; Nguyen, Trung H.; Wang, Can; Quy Van Khuc			The environmental and economic impact of the emissions trading scheme (ETS) in Vietnam	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Vietnam; Environmental policy; Climate change policy; Emissions trading scheme (ETS); GTAP-E; Computable general equilibrium (CGE)	CARBON TAX; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REDUCTION FUND; ENERGY; AUSTRALIA; CGE; POLICY	This study aims to fill a gap in the literature by examining the impacts of an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in Vietnam, as the policy has been discussed for a decade in the country but the likely impacts on the economy and different sectors are still unidentified. The simulations are carried out in a global energy computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, an extension of the GTAP-E model, which treats Vietnam as a country region. Results show that restricting the number of industrial sectors in the emissions trading market substantially affects the country's economy with a decline in real GDP by 4.57%. However, the country experiences much smaller adverse impacts (e.g., real GDP declines by 1.78%) when all industries participate in the emissions trading market. In either case of the ETS design, the coal mining, manufacturing, transportation, and electricity sectors are highly adversely affected; however, the crude oil and natural gas extraction sectors would experience expansion in their production levels due to substitutions for coal. In general, under the policy the emission levels from burning fossil fuels decline at significant rates, particularly from the electricity generation sector.

We analyzed the natural history, treatment and prognosis of DG2 and investigated which genetically defined sub-entities proved unfavorable for survival. Within the prospectively registered, population-based German/Swiss SIOP-LGG 2004 cohort 100 patients (age 0.8-17.8 years, 4% neurofibromatosis [NF1]) were diagnosed with a DG2. Following biopsy (41%) or variable extent of resection (59%), 65 patients received no adjuvant treatment. Radiologic progression or severe neurologic symptoms prompted chemotherapy (n = 18) or radiotherapy (n = 17). Multiple lines of salvage treatment were necessary for 19/35 patients. Five years event-free survival dropped to 0.44, while 5 years overall survival was 0.90 (median observation time 8.3 years). Extensive genetic profiling of 65/100 DG2 identified Histone3-K27M-mutation in 4, IDH1-mutation in 11, BRAF-V600-mutation in 12, KIAA1549-BRAF-fusions in 6 patients, while the remaining 32 tumor tissues did not show alterations of these genes. Progression to malignant glioma occurred in 12 cases of all genetically defined subgroups within a range of 0.5 to 10.8 years, except for tumors carrying KIAA1549-BRAF-fusions. Histone3-K27M-mutant tumors proved uniformly fatal within 0.6 to 2.4 years. The current LGG treatment strategy seems appropriate for all DG2-entities, with the exemption of Histone3-K27M-mutant tumors that require a HGG-related treatment strategy. Our data confirm the importance to genetically define pediatric low-grade diffuse gliomas for proper treatment decisions and risk assessment.

Determinants of incident dementia in different old age groups: results of the prospective AgeCoDe/AgeQualiDe study	INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS			English	Article						incidence; neurodegenerative diseases; determinants; risk factors; modifiable factors; age-specific; advanced age; APOE epsilon 4	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES; RISK; ASSOCIATION; PREDICTION; GERMAN; COMMON; IMPACT; RATES; WOMEN	Objectives: To examine the impact of determinants of incident dementia in three different old age groups (75-79, 80-84, 85+years) in Germany. Design: Multicenter prospective AgeCoDe/AgeQualiDe cohort study with baseline and nine follow-up assessments at 1.5-year intervals. Setting: Primary care medical record registry sample. Participants: General practitioners' (GPs) patients aged 75+years at baseline. Measurements: Conduction of standardized interviews including neuropsychological assessment and collection of GP information at each assessment wave. We used age-stratified competing risk regression models (accounting for the competing event of mortality) to assess determinants of incident dementia and age-stratified ordinary least square regressions to quantify the impact of identified determinants on the age at dementia onset. Results: Among 3027 dementia-free GP patients, n = 704 (23.3%) developed dementia during the 13-year study period. Worse cognitive performance and subjective memory decline with related worries at baseline, and the APOE epsilon 4 allele were associated independently with increased dementia risk in all three old age groups. Worse cognitive performance at baseline was also associated with younger age at dementia onset in all three age groups. Other well-known determinants were associated with dementia risk and age at dementia onset only in some or in none of the three old age groups. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence for the age-specific importance of determinants of incident dementia in old age. Such specifics have to be considered more strongly particularly with regard to potential approaches of early detection and prevention of dementia.

Comparative bioacoustical analyses of these calls can be useful for taxonomic purposes. Phylogenetic relationships within the genera Pseudis are controversial, especially those related to P. platensis, which is often considered a full species or a subspecies within P. paradoxa. The advertisement call of P. platensis has not been described in detail; therefore, call comparisons of these two conspecifics have not been possible. In this study, we describe the advertisement call and diet activity pattern of P. platensis in the Brazilian Pantanal and compare the calls of P. platensis and P. paradoxa to elucidate whether acoustical parameters may help resolve the present uncertain taxonomic treatment. The advertisement call of P. platensis lasted 0.21 +/- 0.01 s and consisted of a short series of 8.05 +/- 0.69 distinct pulses (9.34 +/- 2.94 ins of pulse duration). The vocal activity of the species was largely restricted to a few hours after dusk (7-11 p.m.), which is inconsistent with the diurnal and nocturnal calling behavior described for other Pseudis congeners. The advertisement calls of P. platensis and P. paradoxa were similar in note duration, number of pulses per note and dominant frequency. The geographic variation of calls within species was similar to that found among species. This bioacoustical comparison does not provide new insights into whether P. platensis should be considered a distinct species.

Since this vascular mechanotransduction may involve microRNAs (miRNAs), we investigated the FSS-induced expression of vascular cell miRNAs and their functional impact on collateral artery growth during arteriogenesis. Approach and Results: To this end, rats underwent femoral artery ligation and arteriovenous anastomosis to increase collateral blood flow to maximize FSS and trigger collateral vessel remodeling. Five days after surgery, a miRNA expression profile was obtained from collateral tissue, and upregulation of 4 miRNAs (miR-24-3p, miR-143-3p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-195-5p) was verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Knockdown of miRNAs at the same time of the surgery in an in vivo mouse ligation and recovery model demonstrated that inhibition of miR-143-3p only severely impaired blood flow recovery due to decreased arteriogenesis. In situ hybridization revealed distinct localization of miR-143-3p in the vessel wall of growing collateral arteries predominantly in smooth muscle cells. To investigate the mechanotransduction of FSS leading to the increased miR-143-3p expression, cultured endothelial cells were exposed to FSS. This provoked the expression and release of TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta), which increased the expression of miR-143-3p in smooth muscle cells in the presence of SRF (serum response factor) and myocardin. COL5A2 (collagen type V-alpha 2)-a target gene of miR-143-3p predicted by in silico analysis-was found to be downregulated in growing collaterals. Conclusions: These results indicate that the increased miR-143-3p expression in response to FSS might contribute to the reorganization of the extracellular matrix, which is important for vascular remodeling processes, by inhibiting collagen V-alpha 2 biosynthesis.

J	Furness, M				Furness, Mark			"Donorship" and strategic policy-making: Germany's Middle Eastern and North African aid programme since the Arab uprisings	DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW			English	Article						aid effectiveness; German development co-operation; Middle East and North Africa; ownership; policy coherence	HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISM; EU; SECURITIZATION; POWER	Motivation Germany's official aid to Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries has more than doubled since 2011, ostensibly to support their own responses to development and humanitarian challenges following the Arab uprisings. The dramatic increases in aid have not been accompanied by a public strategy setting out Germany's objectives in the region, and the role of aid in conjunction with other policy tools in achieving them. Purpose What strategic objectives does the German government have for its MENA aid, and have these objectives changed in response to the Arab uprisings? Does the practice of Germany's aid spending actually address development and humanitarian challenges in the MENA region, as these are defined by MENA countries themselves? In order to address these questions, this article develops key insights from the historical institutionalist and aid effectiveness literature that explain strategic policy-making in complex decision-making systems. Approach and Methods Two propositions are discussed in a structured review of the policy and practice dimensions of Germany's MENA aid programme: first, that Germany's aid and foreign policy system has not been able to articulate a clear strategy due to political differences and bureaucratic inertia; and second that the priorities tend to favour German and European security interests rather than the region's own development and humanitarian priorities. Findings The analysis reveals that, while new priorities for development co-operation in response to the Arab uprisings have been set, Germany's MENA aid programme shows signs of policy incoherence and fragmentation. This is unlikely to change without a "whole-of-government" strategy for Germany's MENA engagement. Furthermore, while there is little evidence of purposeful securitization of aid, short-term stability has been privileged over support for political change. Policy Implications A whole-of-government strategy based on the Sustainable Development Goals could balance German interests with the MENA region's development priorities, ironing out the most problematic incoherencies, and thereby increasing partner country ownership.

J	Keijzer, N; Klingebiel, S; Scholtes, F				Keijzer, Niels; Klingebiel, Stephan; Scholtes, Fabian			Promoting ownership in a "post-aid effectiveness" world: Evidence from Rwanda and Liberia	DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW			English	Article						aid effectiveness; development co-operation; foreign aid; Liberia; ownership; post-conflict states; Rwanda	AFRICA	Motivation After generating considerable momentum in the period 2005-2011, policy debates on the aid effectiveness agenda-including the core principle of ownership-witnessed a sharp decline. Current trends raise questions about the continuing relevance of ownership as a fundamental principle for development co-operation. Purpose This article analyses how approaches to managing development co-operation have evolved in Rwanda and Liberia, two aid-dependent post-conflict states that were previously at the forefront of the aid effectiveness agenda. It presents new evidence on how ownership features and is promoted in development co-operation relations. Approach and Methods The article draws on 48 semi-structured interviews, complemented by a review of academic literature, policy documents and grey sources concerning the two countries and the broader subject matter. Findings Recent years have shown considerable drift in Liberia's approach to development co-operation management, while Rwanda retained its established system to manage its external partnerships and incentivize donor behaviour. Both cases illustrate challenges in promoting ownership among all relevant stakeholders, with a key shift being that donors increasingly favour the "what" of co-operation over the "how." Policy implications In view of the importance of ownership for the sustainability of development co-operation, policy-makers should consider reinvigorating and repositioning a self-standing development effectiveness agenda. Such an international initiative should adjust to new co-operation trends, notably the increased practice of predetermining co-operation themes and the promotion of multi-stakeholder approaches.

J	Keijzer, N; Black, D				Keijzer, Niels; Black, David			Special issue introduction Ownership in a post-aid effectiveness era: Comparative perspectives	DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW			English	Article						2030 Agenda; aid effectiveness; development co-operation; foreign aid; local participation; ownership; partnership	DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION; COUNTRY OWNERSHIP; FOREIGN-AID	Motivation Close to 15 years have passed since the adoption of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which generated unprecedented efforts to advance effective development co-operation with a central focus on developing country ownership. Under today's international development co-operation realities, involving inclusive agendas, strategic divergence and increasing competition, discussions on ownership, harmonization and alignment have lost traction. Yet the practices of development co-operation relationships show strong continuities. Purpose This special issue examines how the principle of ownership may be understood and advanced under these new conditions. National ownership is prioritized in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development yet has so far been marginalized by a predominantly piecemeal response and by the rise of "mutual benefit" co-operation. Approach and Methods This special issue takes an inductive approach to studying specific cases and actors bearing on the challenge of understanding and advancing ownership today, in order to inform future policy and research. The contributions to this special issue mainly draw from qualitative research designs that present detailed research inquiries into specific country and actor cases, drawing from interviews, structured desk reviews of policy documents and the rich body of literature on development effectiveness. They are complemented by two contributions that respectively present quantitative research and probe the critical and post-development literature for additional insights. Findings Findings point to an increasing prevalence of pragmatism and self-interest among all actors, to the detriment of national ownership. Broad co-operation agendas, a sense of urgency interpreted as a search for quick results, and more diverse, interest- and outcome-driven forms of multi-stakeholder partnerships all entail a more assertive and proactive approach on the part of external actors. Under these conditions, local initiative may either become stifled or be reasoned away. Given this, today's dominant approaches to co-operation raise concerns about their ethics and sustainability. Policy implications Ownership remains both a requirement and a desired outcome of international co-operation and is key to the effective use of public funding. A key requirement to revitalizing the debate on and practice of ownership is to gather better evidence as the basis for informed scrutiny. To this end, policy-makers need to reprioritize independent evaluation at both the individual and collective level.

Scalaron-Higgs inflation	NUCLEAR PHYSICS B			English	Article							BROKEN-SYMMETRIC THEORY; COSMOLOGICAL PERTURBATIONS; MULTICOMPONENT INFLATON; DENSITY PERTURBATIONS; INITIAL CONDITIONS; EINSTEIN GRAVITY; FIELD; RENORMALIZATION; SPECTRUM; GENERATION	In scalaron-Higgs inflation the Standard Model Higgs boson is non-minimally coupled to gravity and the Einstein-Hilbert action is supplemented by the quadratic scalar curvature invariant. For the quartic Higgs self-coupling lambda fixed at the electroweak scale, we find that the resulting inflationary two-field model effectively reduces to a single field model with the same predictions as in Higgs inflation or Starobinsky inflation, including the limit of a vanishing non-minimal coupling. For the same model, but with the scalar field a priori not identified with the Standard Model Higgs boson, we study the inflationary consequences of an extremely small lambda. Depending on the initial conditions for the inflationary background trajectories, we find that the two-field dynamics either again reduces to an effective single-field model with a larger tensor-to-scalar ratio than predicted in Higgs inflation and Starobinsky inflation, or involves the full two-field dynamics and leads to oscillatory features in the inflationary power spectrum. Finally, we investigate under which conditions the inflationary scenario with extremely small lambda can be realized dynamically by the Standard Model renormalization group flow and discuss how the scalaron-Higgs model can provide a natural way to stabilize the electroweak vacuum.

In particular, mobile electroencephalography (EEG) devices can be potentially used in low cost screening for epilepsy and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. The necessary condition for such applications is thoughtful validation in the specific medical context. As part of validation and quality assurance, we developed a computer-based analysis pipeline, which aims to compare the EEG signal acquired by a mobile EEG device to the one collected by a medically approved clinical-grade EEG device. Both signals are recorded simultaneously during 30 min long sessions in resting state. The data are collected from 22 patients with epileptiform abnormalities in EEG. In order to compare two multichannel EEG signals with differently placed references and electrodes, a novel data processing pipeline is proposed. It allows deriving matching pairs of time series which are suitable for similarity assessment through Pearson correlation. The average correlation of 0.64 is achieved on a test dataset, which can be considered a promising result, taking the positions shift due to the simultaneous electrode placement into account.

We show the existence of a constant C>0 only depending on g so that lambda 1(M)is an element of[C-1/vol(M)2,Clogvol(M)/vol(M)22g-2/(22g-2-1)] and that this estimate is essentially sharp. We show that if M is typical or random, then we have lambda 1(M)is an element of[C-1/vol(M)2,C/vol(M)2].

Mosquito distribution, diversity, and bloodmeal sources were examined to compare Rift Valley fever (RVF) risk among irrigated, riverine, and pastoral ecosystems in Bura, Tana River County, Kenya, between September 2014 and June 2015. Thirty-eight households and 21 irrigation fields were selected for the study. Mosquitoes were trapped with carbon dioxide-impregnated CDC traps, one trap per household and three traps per irrigated field, and morphologically identified using taxonomic keys. Host DNA was extracted from engorged females and cytochrome b genes amplified by PCR to identify sources of bloodmeals. A total of 21,015 mosquitoes were collected; 5742 within households in the 3 ecosystems and 15,273 within irrigated fields. Mosquitoes collected within irrigated fields belonged to 8 genera and 37 species, while those from households within the irrigation scheme belonged to 6 genera and 29 species. Collections from riverine and pastoral households belonged to five and four genera, respectively. The most abundant genera in the irrigated fields were Aedes (21%) and Mansonia (22%), while Anopheles (43%) was the most abundant within households. Most mosquitoes in riverine and pastoral households belonged to Anopheles (76%) and Aedes (65%) genera, respectively. Seasonal variation driven by rainfall was evidenced by spikes in mosquito numbers within irrigated and riverine ecosystems. Host species identification revealed that goats and humans were the main sources of bloodmeal. There was an overall increase in mosquito abundance and diversity as a result of the presence of the irrigated ecosystem in this county, and an increased availability of highly RVF-susceptible hosts as a result of the establishment and concentration of residential areas, promoting potential vector-host contacts. These results highlight the impact of anthropogenic changes on mosquito ecology, potentially heightening the risk of transmission and maintenance of RVF in this region.

ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						Childhood health; Infection-related hospitalization; Education; Earnings; Mediation	CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; HEALTH; IMPACT; LOCI; CONSEQUENCES; VARIANTS; METAANALYSIS; ASSOCIATION; EXPOSURE; RAMADAN	A burgeoning body of literature suggests that poor childhood health leads to adverse health outcomes. lower educational attainment and weaker labour market outcomes in adulthood. We focus on an important but under-researched topic, which is the role played by infection-related hospitalization (IRH) in childhood and its links to labour market outcomes later in life. The participants aged 24-30 years in 2001 N =1706 were drawn from the Young Finns Study, which includes comprehensive registry data on IRHs in childhood at ages 0-18 years. These data are linked to longitudinal registry information on labour market outcomes (2001-2012) and parental background (1980). The estimations were performed using ordinary least squares (OLS). The results showed that having an additional IRH is associated with lower log earnings (b = 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.193; -0.026). fewer years of being employed (b = -0.018. 95% CI: -0.031; -0.005). a higher probability of receiving any social income transfers (b = 0.012, 95 % CI: -0.002; 0.026) and larger social income transfers, conditional on receiving any (b = 0.085,95 % CI: 0.025; 0.145). IRHs are negatively linked to human capital accumulation. which explains a considerable part of the observed associations between IRHs and labour market outcomes. We did not find support for the hypothesis that adult health mediates the link. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Mansourian, S; Vallauri, D				Mansourian, Stephanie; Vallauri, Daniel			How to Learn Lessons from Field Experience in Forest Landscape Restoration: A Tentative Framework	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Lessons learned; Learning; Knowledge; Conservation; FLR; Restoration	ORGANIZATIONS; CONSERVATION; KNOWLEDGE; REFORESTATION; COMANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; POLICY	Lesson learning from field implementation generates new knowledge that is particularly important in the context of recently developed approaches, processes and complex systems with limited history and much uncertainty. One such approach is forest landscape restoration (FLR). Although grounded in a number of disciplines (e.g., conservation biology, landscape ecology, restoration ecology), FLR has remained very fluid and molded to suit different stakeholders, from local to global. Today, many countries or organizations pledge to implement FLR. Global commitments, especially following the Bonn Challenge on FLR (established in 2011), aim to upscale FLR to achieve social, biodiversity, and carbon benefits. However, the FLR approach is relatively new (<20 years), complex due to its multifaceted nature, and long-term field experience and results are still limited. That makes lesson learning from past, ongoing and related approaches particularly urgent. We propose here a first attempt at a framework for lesson learning in FLR that can serve to ground both practice and policy in field experiences to date.

Lu-Hf geochronology of ultra-high-pressure eclogites from the Tromso-Nappe, Scandinavian Caledonides: evidence for rapid subduction and exhumation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article; Early Access						Lu-Hf geochronology; UHP metamorphism; Garnet; Scandinavian Caledonides; Tromso Nappe	WESTERN GNEISS REGION; UHP METAMORPHISM; UPPERMOST ALLOCHTHON; BEARING ECLOGITE; HP METAMORPHISM; COMPLEX; ROCKS; EXAMPLE; PROGRADE; KYANITE	Geochronology of ultra-high-pressure metamorphic rocks is able to constrain the timing and rates of subduction-zone processes. Lu-Hf garnet dating has the potential to yield information about the timing of the prograde evolution of subducting rocks under increasing pressure. In combination with other methods, it thus allows constraining the complete P-T-t path with high precision. Ultra-high-pressure eclogites from the Tromso Nappe, the structurally highest tectonic unit of the Scandinavian Caledonides in northern Norway, were dated using Lu-Hf geochronology on garnet. A sample from Tromsdalstind yielded an age of 448.3 +/- 3.6 Ma, interpreted as dating prograde garnet growth due to preserved zoning in the major-element and Lu contents of garnet grains. A sample from the diamond-bearing locality Tonsvika yielded an identical age of 449.4 +/- 3.3 Ma. Garnet from this sample shows a weak zoning in Ca content and near-homogeneous Lu content. These ages are identical within error among each other and with published U-Pb ages of peak-eclogite-facies zircon and rutile/titanite from exhumation-related leucosome veins. Consequently, the entire subduction-exhumation cycle leading to the ultra-high-pressure eclogites lasted only very few millions of years during the Late Ordovician.

Patients with malignant diseases are assumed to be at increased risk for a worse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore, guidance regarding prevention and management of the infection as well as safe administration of cancer-therapy is required. Here, we provide recommendations for the management of patients with malignant disease in the times of COVID-19. These recommendations were prepared by an international panel of experts and then consented by the EHA Scientific Working Group on Infection in Hematology. The primary aim is to enable clinicians to provide optimal cancer care as safely as possible, since the most important protection for patients with malignant disease is the best-possible control of the underlying disease.

There are various features-based seizures classification algorithms listed in the literature. But, there is no standardized set of attributes that can perfectly capture the relevant information regarding the signal dynamics. In this paper, a computationally-fast seizure classification algorithm is presented. The obtained results through the proposed algorithm are consistent and repeatable. This paper describes an automated seizures classification technique using the nonlinear higher-order statistics and deep neural network algorithms. The sparse autoencoder based deep neural network is used to extract the essential structural details from the third-order cumulant coefficients matrix. The proposed algorithm achieves a reliable classification accuracy for both categories, i.e., binary classes and three-classes of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with the softmax classifier. The proposed study is simulated on the publicly-available Bonn university EEG database. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for seizures classification.

Zika Virus Circulation in Mali	EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							BLOOD-DONORS; PREVALENCE; SEROPREVALENCE; TRANSMISSION; ARBOVIRUS; OUTBREAK; ANGOLA; IGG	The circulation of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Mali has not been clearly characterized. Therefore, we conducted a serologic survey of 793 asymptomatic volunteers >15 years of age (2016), and 637 blood donors (2013) to assess the seroprevalence of ZIKV infection in 2 ecoclimatic regions of Mali, tropical savannah and warm semiarid region, using ELISA and seroneutralization assays. The overall seroprevalence was approximate to 12% and increased with age, with no statistical difference between male and female participants. In the warm semiarid study sites we detected immunological markers of an outbreak that occurred in the late 1990s in 18% (95% CI 13%-23%) of participants. In tropical savannah sites, we estimated a low rate of endemic transmission, with 2.5% (95% CI 2.0%-3.1%) of population infected by ZIKV annually. These data demonstrate the circulation of ZIKV in Mali and provide evidence of a previously unidentified outbreak that occurred in the late 1990s.

To investigate the impact of environmental quality on the market, we collect data from a used-car online advertisement platform. We find that the supply of used VW diesel vehicles increases after the VW emission scandal. The positive supply effects increase with the probability of manipulation. Furthermore, we find negative impacts on the asking prices of used cars subject to a high probability of manipulation. We rationalize these findings with a model for sorting by the environmental quality of used cars. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, hepatocytes, the parenchymal cells of the liver, also possess potent immunological functions in addition to their known metabolic functions. Owing to their abundance in the liver and known immunological functions, we aimed to investigate the direct antiviral mechanisms employed by hepatocytes. Methods: Using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as a model of liver infection, we first assessed the role of myeloid cells by depletion prior to infection. We investigated the role of hepatocyte-intrinsic innate immune signaling by infecting mice lacking canonical NF-kappa B signaling (Ikk beta(Delta Hep)) specifically in hepatocytes. In addition, mice lacking hepatocyte-specific interferon-alpha/beta signaling-(Ifnar(Delta Hep)), or interferon-alpha/beta signaling in myeloid cells-(Ifnar(Delta Myel)) were infected. Results: Here, we demonstrate that LCMV activates NF-kappa B signaling in hepatocytes. LCMV-triggered NF-kappa B activation in hepatocytes did not depend on Kupffer cells or TNFR1 signaling but rather on Toll-like receptor signaling. LCMV-infected Ikk beta(Delta Hep) livers displayed strongly elevated viral titers due to LCMV accumulation within hepatocytes, reduced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, delayed intrahepatic immune cell influx and delayed intrahepatic LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. Notably, viral clearance and ISG expression were also reduced in LCMV-infected primary hepatocytes lacking IKK beta, demonstrating a hepatocyte-intrinsic effect. Similar to livers of Ikk beta(Delta Hep) mice, enhanced hepatocytic LCMV accumulation was observed in livers of Ifnar(Delta Hep) mice, whereas IfnarDMyel mice were able to control LCMV infection. Hepatocytic NF-kappa B signaling was also required for efficient ISG induction in HDV-infected dHepaRG cells and interferon-alpha/beta-mediated inhibition of HBV replication in vitro. Conclusions: Together, these data show that hepatocyte-intrinsic NF-kappa B is a vital amplifier of interferon-alpha/beta signaling, which is pivotal for strong early ISG responses, immune cell infiltration and hepatic viral clearance. Lay summary: Innate immune cells have been ascribed a primary role in controlling viral clearance upon hepatic infections. We identified a novel dual role for NF-kappa B signaling in infected hepatocytes which was crucial for maximizing interferon responses and initiating adaptive immunity, thereby efficiently controlling hepatic virus replication.

Current knowledge about diversity patterns of epiphytes mainly stems from local studies or floristic inventories, but this information has not yet been integrated to allow a better understanding of large-scale distribution patterns. EpIG-DB, the first database on epiphyte assemblages at the continental scale, resulted from an exhaustive compilation of published and unpublished inventory data from the Neotropics. The current version of EpIG-DB consists of 463,196 individual epiphytes from 3,005 species, which were collected from a total of 18,148 releves (host trees and 'understory' plots). EpIG-DB reports the occurrence of 'true' epiphytes, hemiepiphytes and nomadic vines, including information on their cover, abundance, frequency and biomass. Most records (97%) correspond to sampled host trees, 76% of them aggregated in forest plots. The data is stored in a TURBOVEG database using the most up-to-date checklist of vascular epiphytes. A total of 18 additional fields were created for the standardization of associated data commonly used in epiphyte ecology (e.g. by considering different sampling methods). EpIG-DB currently covers six major biomes across the whole latitudinal range of epiphytes in the Neotropics but welcomes data globally. This novel database provides, for the first time, unique biodiversity data on epiphytes for the Neotropics and unified guidelines for future collection of epiphyte data. EpIG-DB will allow exploration of new ways to study the community ecology and biogeography of vascular epiphytes.

Trained Immunity: Linking Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease across the Life-Course?	TRENDS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM			English	Review							NATURAL-KILLER-CELLS; HEMATOPOIETIC STEM; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; PROGENITOR CELLS; INNATE IMMUNITY; NONSPECIFIC PROTECTION; BCG VACCINATION; ADIPONECTIN; INFLAMMATION; ATHEROSCLEROSIS	Obesity, a chronic inflammatory disease, is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms underlying inflammation in obesity are incompletely understood. Recent developments have challenged the dogma of immunological memory occurring exclusively in the adaptive immune system and show that the innate immune system has potential to be reprogrammed. This innate immune memory (trained immunity) is characterized by epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of myeloid cells following endogenous or exogenous stimulation, resulting in enhanced inflammation to subsequent stimuli. Trained immunity phenotypes have now been reported for other immune and non-immune cells. Here, we provide a novel perspective on the putative role of trained immunity in mediating the adverse cardiovascular effects of obesity and highlight potential translational pathways.

Protected percutaneous coronary intervention applies temporary percutaneous ventricular assist devices to mitigate potential hemodynamic compromise in high-risk patients. The Impella system is currently the most commonly used device for protected percutaneous coronary intervention and showed improved hemodynamic parameters in earlier trials. Methods: This study was designed as a retrospective, observational multi-center registry conducted in ten hospitals in Germany. We included consecutive patients undergoing protected high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention with Impella support. The primary endpoint was defined as the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event defined as all-cause mortality, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, or stroke during a postprocedural 180-day follow-up period. Results: In total, 157 patients (80.3% male; mean age 71.8 +/- 10.8 years) were included in the present study, and 180-day follow-up was complete for 149 patients (94.9%). At baseline, the patients had a median left ventricular ejection fraction of 39.0% (interquartile range, 25.0-50.0%). The median SYNergy between PCI with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery-Score I was 33.0 (interquartile range, 24.0-40.5) and the median EuroSCORE II was 7.2% (interquartile range, 3.2-17.1%). During postprocedural follow-up, 34 patients (22.8%) suffered a major adverse cardiac event. All-cause mortality was 18.1% (27 patients). Nine patients (6.0%) sustained a ST-elevation myocardial infarction, while 4 patients (2.7%) had a stroke. Conclusions: Patients undergoing protected high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention with Impella support showed an acceptable 180-day clinical outcome regarding major adverse cardiac event and mortality.

In Colombia, more than 80,000 ha are covered by dredged sediment. Technosols developed from such deposits undergo strong transformations during the early stages of formation due to the diverse nature of the constituents. The aims of this study are (i) to investigate changes in soil morphological and physicochemical properties at early stages of pedogenesis, (ii) to estimate the variability of size structure distribution of the new plant cover as affected by the time period since establishment and deposit type, and (iii) to determine which soil parameters correlate best with the size structure distribution of vegetation. Materials and methods Soil characterization through morphological and physicochemical analysis was conducted on Technosols developed from gravel and sandy deposits of different ages (0-12 years). A vegetation survey was conducted to measure tree dimensions and identify the most common species. Data were analyzed using non-parametric tests to avoid the loss of information due to data smoothing. Results and discussion The studied Technosols are subject to processes similar to those occurring in natural parent materials such as mineral transformations, changes in redox conditions, organic matter accumulation in the topsoil, and a rapid differentiation of horizons. However, the Technosols in our study sites show an unusually fast development not often observed in natural soils, with drastic changes observed at very early stages of formation. Gravel deposits offer more favorable conditions for plant growth, and marked changes in pedogenic processes can be observed compared with sandy deposits, which are reflected in changes of chemical properties. Conclusions Factors such as the technology used for mining and the continuous deposition of dredged sediments in a cumulative way during the exploitation period, as well as the disturbances after deposition, result in a high diversity of constituents and high heterogeneity of dredged sediment deposits. Gravel and sand deposits, originated from the same sections of the river and after similar separation processes for ore extraction, undergo divergent pedogenic processes at different rates, which could be explained by a remarkable effect of particle size distribution. For vegetation establishment, the selection of tree species should be based on their capacity for nutrient pumping through deep rooting to sequester carbon and to adapt morphologically to heterogeneity in nutrient availability by growing roots in nutrient-rich zones.

MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						X-ray absorption spectroscopy; XANES; Ceramics; Firing temperature; Poverty point objects	POTTERY; SPECTROSCOPY	Test samples have been fabricated similar to Poverty Point Objects (PPOs) using silty loam from the UNESCO World Heritage Site Poverty Point. In an oxidative atmosphere these objects were fired in a defined way to 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C, and 800 degrees C respectively. For all samples, including a non-heated one, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were measured at the Ca-K-edge. Two of the characteristic features of these spectra were used for obtaining for the first time a calibration curve for determining the firing temperature of ceramic objects. Using this calibration curve, the "firing temperature", i.e. the highest temperature these objects have been used at of two Poverty Point Objects found at smaller sites (Terra' Lewis, Caney Mounds) could be estimated at similar to 500 degrees C-a typical temperature for a wood fire. This result supports in a direct way the hypothesis that at least some of the Poverty Point Objects have been used as cooking stones.

The contralateral neck failure rate in head and neck carcinoma treated postoperatively with ipsilateral neck irradiation only was evaluated. Methods Patients with carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, or hypopharynx without midline extension treated between 1990 and 2016 were analyzed. After tumor resection and neck dissection (ND), radiotherapy was given to the primary tumor site and ipsilateral neck. High-risk patients additionally received concurrent chemotherapy. Freedom from contralateral neck recurrence (FCNR), locoregional control rate (LRC), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated. Results 197 patients (median age 60.7 years, 66.5% males, 52.8% oropharyngeal carcinomas) were analyzed. Complete resection (R0) was achieved in 85.8% of cases. Ipsilateral ND was performed in all patients and contralateral ND in 144 patients (73.1%). Concurrent chemotherapy was given to 59 patients (30.0%). After a median follow-up of 45.5 months, OS and DFS of all patients were 73.6% and 70.9% at 5 years, respectively. A total of 45 patients (22.8%) suffered from a locoregional recurrence, lymph node metastases of the contralateral neck developed in 12 patients (6.1%) only. There was no significant difference in contralateral nodal failure rate with or without performance of contralateral ND. Conclusion Regional failure of the contralateral neck was low after surgery and ipsilateral neck irradiation in head and neck carcinomas without midline extension, supporting evidence that contralateral neck radiotherapy can safely be omitted in selected cases.

Behavior in a laboratory experiment suggests that individuals use this ambiguity strategically as a moral wiggle room to act less generously without feeling guilty. Such excuse-driven behavior is more pronounced when the costs of a donation -rather than its benefits- are ambiguous. However, the importance of excuse-driven behavior is comparable under ambiguity and under risk. Individuals exploit any type of uncertainty as an excuse not to give, regardless of the nature of this uncertainty. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms behind framing effects. We study gain-loss framing in binary modified dictator games. Subjects choose the selfish option more often in the loss frame compared to the gain frame. Recording visual fixations with eye-tracking, we find that dictators focus more on their own outcomes when facing losses. This suggests that losses to the own outcome are weighted more than losses to another player. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

I demonstrate that the principal can design information and a mechanism so as to implement the same outcome as if the additional information was publicly known. The key idea is that the principal secretly randomizes over information structures which allows her to cross-check the consistency of agents' reports. As an implication, the principal can fully extract the first-best surplus in a large class of cases. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The lack of mechanistic insight into MDSC suppressive activity and a marker for their identification has hampered attempts to overcome T cell inhibition and unleash anti-cancer immunity. Here, we report that human MDSCs were characterized by strongly reduced metabolism and conferred this compromised metabolic state to CD8(+) T cells, thereby paralyzing their effector functions. We identified accumulation of the dicarbonyl radical methylglyoxal, generated by semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase, to cause the metabolic phenotype of MDSCs and MDSC-mediated paralysis of CD8(+) T cells. In a murine cancer model, neutralization of dicarbonyl activity overcame MDSC-mediated T cell suppression and, together with checkpoint inhibition, improved the efficacy of cancer immune therapy. Our results identify the dicarbonyl methylglyoxal as a marker metabolite for MDSCs that mediates T cell paralysis and can serve as a target to improve cancer immune therapy. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) residing within tumors can impede immune responses. Knolle and colleagues show that MDSCs poison immune cells by producing methylglyoxal, which functionally alters their cellular metabolism and hence their effector responses.

J	Loscher, W				Loescher, Wolfgang			The holy grail of epilepsy prevention: Preclinical approaches to antiepileptogenic treatments	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Epileptogenesis; Seizures; Animal models; Comorbidities; Neurodegeneration	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; LITHIUM-PILOCARPINE MODEL; LARGE ANIMAL-MODELS; INDUCED STATUS EPILEPTICUS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; LONG-TERM TREATMENT; POSTTRAUMATIC EPILEPSY; TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS; ACQUIRED EPILEPSY; MOUSE MODEL	A variety of acute brain insults can induce epileptogenesis, a complex process that results in acquired epilepsy. Despite advances in understanding mechanisms of epileptogenesis, there is currently no approved treatment that prevents the development or progression of epilepsy in patients at risk. The current concept of epileptogenesis assumes a window of opportunity following acute brain insults that allows intervention with preventive treatment. Recent results suggest that injury-induced epileptogenesis can be a much more rapid process than previously thought, suggesting that the 'therapeutic window' may only be open for a brief period, as in stroke therapy. However, experimental data also suggest a second, possibly delayed process ("secondary epileptogenesis") that influences the progression and refractoriness of the epileptic state over time, allowing interfering with this process even after onset of epilepsy. In this review, both methodological issues in preclinical drug development and novel targets for antiepileptogenesis will be discussed. Several promising drugs that either prevent epilepsy (antiepileptogenesis) or slow epilepsy progression and alleviate cognitive or behavioral comorbidities of epilepsy (disease modification) have been described in recent years, using diverse animal models of acquired epilepsy. Promising agents include TrkB inhibitors, losartan, statins, isoflurane, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative drugs, the SV2A modulator levetiracetam, and epigenetic interventions. Research on translational target validity and on prognostic biomarkers that can be used to stratify patients (or experimental animals) at high risk of developing epilepsy will hopefully soon lead to proof-of-concept clinical trials with the most promising drugs, which will be essential to make prevention of epilepsy a reality.

These phenomena reinforce each others and persist during epileptogenesis as well as during chronic spontaneous seizures. Anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant drugs transiently administered either before, or shortly after the clinical onset of symptomatic epilepsy, similarly block the progression of spontaneous seizures, and may delay their onset. Moreover, neuroprotection and rescue of cognitive deficits are also observed in the treated animals. Therefore, although these treatments do not prevent epilepsy development, they offer clinically relevant disease-modification effects. These therapeutic effects are mediated by targeting molecular signaling pathways such as the IL-1 beta-IL-1 receptor type 1 and TLR4, P2X7 receptors, the transcriptional anti-oxidant factor Nrf2, while the therapeutic impact of COX-2 inhibition for reducing spontaneous seizures remains controversial. Some anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant drugs that are endowed of disease modification effects in preclinical models are already in medical use and have a safety profile, therefore, they provide potential re-purposed treatments for improving the disease course and for reducing seizure burden. Markers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress can be measured in blood or by neuroimaging, therefore they represent testable prognostic and predictive biomarkers for selecting the patient's population at high risk for developing epilepsy therefore eligible for novel treatments.

Contrast-enhanced Interstitial Transpedal MR Lymphangiography for Thoracic Chylous Effusions	RADIOLOGY			English	Article							MAGNETIC-RESONANCE LYMPHANGIOGRAPHY; DUCT EMBOLIZATION; EXPERIENCE; LYMPHOGRAPHY; KAPPA	Background: Abnormalities of the central lymphatic system (CLS) are increasingly treated by interventional radiology approaches. Planning of these procedures, however, is challenging because of the lack of clinical imaging tools. Purpose: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of contrast agent-enhanced interstitial transpedal MR lymphangiography in the prein-terventional workup of lymphatic interventions in patients with thoracic chylous effusions. Materials and Methods: Patients with chylous effusions evaluated from January 2014 and December 2017 were included in this retrospective analysis of transpedal MR lymphangiography. Indications were chylothorax (n = 19; 76%), cervical lymphatic fistula (n = 2; 8%), and combined chylothorax and chylous ascites (n = 4; 16%). Patients underwent transpedal MR lymphangiography at 1.5 T with T1-weighted imaging after interstitial pedal of gadolinium-based contrast medium under local anesthesia. Contrast-enhanced MRI was evaluated for technical success, depiction of pathologic abnormalities of the CLS, and access site for lymphatic interventions (ie, clinically useful examination). Reader agreement for image quality and overall degree of visualization was assessed with weighted k. Interrelations between overall image quality and degree of visualization of CLS structures were assessed by Spearman r. Efficacy of transpedal MR lymphangiography was calculated by using radiographic lymphangiography as the reference standard. Results: Twenty-five patients (mean age, 54 years 6 18 [standard deviation]; 13 men) were evaluated. Eight percent (two of 25) of examinations failed (lymphoma in one patient and technical failure in one patient). Contrast agent injection was well tolerated without complications. Interrater agreement of image quality was excellent (k = 0.96). The degree of CLS visualization correlated with overall image quality (r = 0.71; P <= .001). Retroperitoneal lymphatics, cisterna chyli, and thoracic duct were viewed with an accuracy of 23 of 25 (92%), 24 of 25 (96%), and 23 of 25 (92%), respectively. Anatomic variations, a lymphatic pathologic abnormality, and interventional access routes were identified with an accuracy of 22 of 25 (88%), 23 of 25 (92%), and 24 of 25 (96%), respectively. Overall, 23 of 25 (92%) transpedal MR lymphangiograms provided clinically useful information. Conclusion: Transpedal interstitial MR lymphangiography was well tolerated by the patient and identified specific pathologic abnormalities causing thoracic chylous leakages before lymphatic intervention.

We simulate assembly line production in a lab-in-the-field experiment in which workers exert real effort in a minimum-effort game in teams whose members are either socially connected or unconnected and are paid according to the group output. We find that group output increases by 18%, and coordination improves by 30-39% when workers are socially connected with their co-workers. These findings can plausibly be explained by the higher levels of pro-social motivation between co-workers in socially connected teams.

We determine second order topological Hochschild homology of the p-local integers. For the tamely ramified extension of the map from the connective Adams summand to p-local complex topological K-theory we determine the relative topological Hochschild homology and show that it detects the tame ramification of this extension. We show that the complexification map from connective topological real to complex K-theory shows features of a wildly ramified extension. We also determine relative topological Hochschild homology for some quotient maps with commutative quotients.

Rouleaux Club	Procedural training for the management of superficial venous insufficiency: A survey of Rouleaux Club members	PHLEBOLOGY			English	Article						Clinical competence; curriculum; Doppler ultrasound; endovenous thermal ablation; varicose veins	VARICOSE-VEINS; BONN VEIN; SURGERY; UK	Introduction In 2012, the Rouleaux Club published their survey claiming large deficits in venous training. Since then vascular surgery has become its own specialty with a dedicated section of the curriculum for superficial venous intervention. The aim of this study was to assess whether the introduction of the new curriculum has improved current Rouleaux Club members training in superficial venous intervention. Method A trainee designed survey was developed and distributed to UK vascular surgery trainees in summer 2017. Results We received 55 (41.0%) responses. Training in endovenous procedures was available to 100% of trainees, and open surgery was only available to 43.2% of trainees; 86.5% of centres used endovenous procedures as the default intervention Only 75.7% of respondents were timetabled for dedicated superficial venous intervention lists; 72.7% have not received any formal training in duplex ultrasonography. Higher self-reported procedural competence was associated with greater numbers of procedures rather than training grade seniority. Conclusion It seems that despite a separate curriculum there are still self-reported trainee deficits in competence and skills. Low respondent levels (41%) should be considered but there is a potential problem for future venous practice.

Thus far, only limited research regarding the importance of precise work-break activities has been conducted, which becomes crucial to an employer when deciding on investing in additional work-break activities. Therefore, in this study, we investigate whether performance effects induced by work breaks differ for different work-break interventions. Using a laboratory pre-test-post-test-design, the impact of three work-break interventions (namely, relaxation system, boxing, napping) on objective and subjective performance- and state-related determinants is investigated. It was found that the boxing and relaxation system interventions had significantly greater impacts on the performance variables as compared to napping. However, we did not find any significant differences between the two aforementioned interventions - boxing and the relaxation system.

J	Trevisan, A; Venema, V; Kollet, S; Rahman, M				Trevisan, Alessandra; Venema, Victor; Kollet, Stefan; Rahman, Mostaquimur			The topographic control on land surface energy fluxes: A statistical approach to bias correction	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Topographic indices; Statistical model; Bias correction; Potential latent heat; Evapotranspiration surplus	NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION; WATER-TABLE DYNAMICS; SOIL-MOISTURE; GROUNDWATER CONTRIBUTION; WETNESS INDEX; REPRESENTATION; TOPMODEL; SCHEME; DEPTH; MODEL	Subsurface hydrodynamics are an important component of the hydrological cycle and a key factor in the partitioning of land surface water and energy fluxes. Because of computational reasons they are often neglected, or strongly simplified, in numerical weather prediction and climate models. Particularly in regions where the water table is shallow, soil moisture acts as a link between groundwater, land and atmosphere. Because of its long-term memory, groundwater represents a buffer for the effects of climate variability. To dynamically model this system we study the outputs of a variably saturated groundwater flow model (ParFlow) coupled with a surface model (CLM) and propose an empirical approach for the statistical correction of the bias of the energy fluxes in a highly-parametrized simulation. Corrections are based on a comparison of the simple scheme with the fully-coupled subsurface-land-atmosphere simulations. This simple dynamical scheme computes the potential latent heat flux in case of near saturation, while the fully-coupled simulations approximate the reality. Our statistical model examines the evapotranspiration surplus, i.e., the difference in latent heat flux between the two runs, and aims to correct the bias in the latent heat flux of the simple scheme, based on the characteristics of each point of the domain. In particular, we focus on the ability of topography-related indices, such as the topographic wetness index and the depth-to-water index, to provide information on the availability of water for evapotranspiration. Our results confirm that topographic indices are good predictors for moisture availability. While small-scale structures cannot be accurately reproduced by our model, large-scale biases of latent heat flux over the domain are effectively removed. Moreover, the bias corrected fluxes show a better agreement with the fluxes of the full modelling system than commonly used free-drainage simulations. Thus, the proposed approach can be useful in approximating the effect of groundwater on land surface water and energy fluxes in, e.g., regional climate models.

We show here that such equilibrium might never be reached when the system is coupled simultaneously to bosonic and fermionic heat baths unless different thermal reservoirs are related with each others. Conditions under which an asymptotic equilibrium can be reached are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Hovhannisyan, A. A.; Sargsyan, V. V.; Adamian, G.

J	Lubow, C; Bockstiegel, J; Weindl, G				Luebow, Charlotte; Bockstiegel, Judith; Weindl, Guenther			Lysosomotropic drugs enhance pro-inflammatory responses to IL-1 beta in macrophages by inhibiting internalization of the IL-1 receptor	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						IL-1 signaling; Inflammation; Chloroquine; Lysosomotropic drugs; Macrophages; Receptor endocytosis	GENE-EXPRESSION; TNF-ALPHA; T-CELLS; AUTOPHAGY; CHLOROQUINE; ACTIVATION; ENDOCYTOSIS; INTERFERES; ANTAGONIST; INDUCTION	Interleukin (IL)-1 signaling leads to production of pro-inflammatory mediators and is regulated by receptor endocytosis. Lysosomotropic drugs have been linked to increased pro-inflammatory responses under sterile inflammatory conditions but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that lysosomotropic drugs potentiate pro-inflammatory effects in response to IL-1 beta via a mechanism involving reactive oxygen species, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and reduced IL-1 receptor internalization. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine increased IL-1 beta-induced CXCL8 secretion in macrophages which was critically dependent on the lysosomotropic character and inhibition of macroautophagy but independent from the NLRP3 inflammasome. Co-stimulation with the autophagy inducer interferon gamma attenuated CXCL8 release. Other lysosomotropic drugs like bafilomycin A(1), fluoxetine and chlorpromazine but also the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore showed similar pro-inflammatory responses. Increased cell surface expression of IL-1 receptor suggests reduced receptor degradation in the presence of lysosomotropic drugs. Our findings provide new insights into a potentially crucial immunoregulatory mechanism in macrophages that may explain how lysosomotropic drugs drive sterile inflammation.

Vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) is critically involved in a variety of inflammatory processes including cytokine trafficking and lipid mediator biosynthesis. However, its role in eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways in monocytes remains elusive. Here, we present a differential role of V-ATPase in the expression and in the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in human monocytes. Pharmacological targeting of V-ATPase increased the expression of COX-2 protein in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary monocytes, which was paralleled by enhanced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK-1/2, without impacting the NF-kappa B and SAPK/JNK pathways. Targeting of both p38 MAPK and ERK-1/2 pathways showed that the kinase pathways are crucial for COX-2 expression in human monocytes. Despite increased COX-2 protein levels, however, suppression of V-ATPase activity impaired the biosynthesis of COX- and also of 5-lipoxygenase (LOX)-derived lipid mediators in monocytes without affecting 12-/15-LOX products, assessed by a metabololipidomics approach using UPLC-MS-MS analysis. Our results indicate that changes in the intracellular pH may contribute to suppression of COX-2 and 5-LOX activities. We suggest that V-ATPase on one hand limits COX-2 protein levels via restricting p38 MAPK and ERK-1/2 activation, while on the other hand it governs the cellular activity of COX-2 through appropriate adjustment of the intracellular pH.

Small for gestational age (SGA) is a measure based on birth weight and gestational age at birth and represents a good indicator of fetal growth but it has been used only in a small number of studies. We examined the association between PFAS exposure and the risk of severe SGA in a PFAS contaminated area in the Veneto Region (North-East of Italy). Methods: A retrospective cohort study has been developed including all singleton live births reported in the Veneto Region Birth Registry between 2003 and 2018 to mothers living in the contaminated and in a control area. We estimated the association between mothers' area of residence and severe SGA using crude RR (and 95% CI) and stepwise logistic regression, including all the maternal characteristics. Results: The study included 105,114 singleton live births. The occurence of severe SGA was 3.44% in the contaminated area and 2.67% in the control area. The multivariate analysis confirmed that living in the contaminated area significantly increased the odds of severe SGA (adjusted OR 1.27 (95% C.I. 1.16, 1.39)). Conclusions: The findings suggest that living in a contaminated area by PFAS plays a role in affecting fetal growth and support the hypothesis that PFAS exposure is a risk factor for SGA. Individual data on exposure are needed to confirm the direct association.

Stream function - vorticity formulation of mixture mass flow	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS			English	Article						Two-phase mass flow; Stream function; Vorticity; Vorticity-transport equation; Pressure Poisson equation; Analytical solutions	VARIABLE-DENSITY GROUNDWATER; PRESSURE FORMULATION; STOKES PROBLEM; DEBRIS FLOW; VELOCITY	Employing a generalized quasi two-phase bulk mixture mass flow model derived from a general two-phase model (Pudasaini, 2012), here, we formulate a stream function - vorticity and vorticity-transport equation for a rapid flow of mixture of viscous fluid and solid particles down a channel. The original system of partial differential equations (PDEs) in velocity and pressure is converted into the reduced stream function - vorticity form as a close system of equations that is free of pressure which replaces the original system of three equations by a set of just two PDEs as an advantage of the new model. A novel pressure Poisson equation in terms of stream function, vorticity and the rate-dependent mixture viscosity is derived. For given mixture viscosity, our pressure Poisson equation can provide mixture pressure. The two equations are coupled through the Poisson equation to provide the full system in stream function, vorticity and mixture pressure to describe the dynamics of mixture flow. However, the pressure is decoupled and can also be computed separately using stream function and vorticity. We further reduce the new system to obtain exact expressions for stream function. One of the most important advancements here is the construction of a new pressure Poisson equation for shear mixture flows that includes yield strength of the mixture. We also discuss the importance of pressure Poisson equation induced by the flow field intensity, the yield strength, and free surface geometry. Our results show that the pressure Poisson equation is mainly characterized by the non-linear diffusion of the free surface. Furthermore, mixture pressures are derived analytically for thin and thick flows. Similarly, different flow scenarios such as pressure dominated flow; thick, low yield strength flow; and thin, high yield strength flows are analyzed. Several exact/analytical solutions are constructed for the pressure and flow depth distributions for incipient flow, shearing flow, free surface flow, propagating bore front and mass deposition. The novel models developed here and analytical results are consistent with the observed phenomena indicating their application potential in detailed description of the mixture flow dynamics more efficiently than the existing complex models.

However, the removal of fat often impairs the sensory and textural properties of foods, leading to low consumer acceptance. In this study, we tested various concentrations of fat replacers (inulin, corn dextrin, polydextrose, and microparticulated whey protein) combined with rennet casein to investigate their effects on the melting behavior, dynamic rheological properties, and hardness of reduced-fat processed cheese. We found that increasing concentrations of inulin and corn dextrin reduced the flowability of cheese in the melting test and can thus be used to inhibit flow during heating. Microparticulated whey protein did not affect flowability but caused an increase in the storage and loss moduli as well as the temperature at gel-sol transition. A similar effect was also shown for rennet casein, whereas inulin and polydextrose had little or no effect on these rheological parameters. Corn dextrin had no effect on the storage and loss moduli, but affected the gel-sol transition temperature. No changes in hardness were detected for any concentration of the fat replacers, but increasing the rennet casein content also increased the hardness of the samples, regardless of the fat replacer used. Our results indicate the different concentrations and combinations of fat replacers and rennet casein that can be included in reduced-fat processed cheese to develop products with specific rheological properties, thus meeting future demand for reduced-fat products with attractive sensory attributes.

Liquid molasses interacts with buffers to affect ruminal fermentation, milk fatty acid profile, and milk fat synthesis in dairy cows fed high-concentrate diets	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						milk fat depression; soluble carbohydrate; ruminal pH; trans fatty acid	RUMEN FERMENTATION; SODIUM-BICARBONATE; PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE; NUTRIENT UTILIZATION; CARBOHYDRATE SOURCE; SUGAR CONCENTRATION; BARLEY-GRAIN; GRASS-SILAGE; IN-VITRO; PH	We aimed to evaluate the effects of feeding sugarcane liquid molasses (LM) with or without a commercial buffer mix (BFM) on ruminal fermentation parameters, milk fatty acid (FA) profile, and milk yield and composition in dairy cows fed high-concentrate diets (35:65 forage-to-concentrate ratio). Eight multiparous Holstein cows (4 ruminally cannulated) averaging 165 +/- 12 d in milk at the beginning of the study were randomly assigned to a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Each period lasted 21 d with 14 d for diet adaptation and 7 d for data and sample collection. Cows were fed the following diets: (1) no LM or BFM supplementation (CTRL), (2) LM without BFM supplementation (MOL), (3) BFM without LM supplementation (BUF), and (4) LM plus BFM supplementation (COMBO). These 4 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were formulated by replacing (dry matter basis) 5% ground corn with LM, whereas BFM replaced wheat bran at 0.8% of the diet. Significant LM x BFM interactions were observed for the duration of ruminal pH below 5.8, molar proportion of propionate, acetate-to-propionate ratio, milk proportions of trans-10 18:1 and total trans FA, and concentration and yield of milk fat. Feeding MOL and BUF alone were effective on reducing the time that ruminal pH remained below 5.8 compared with the CTRL treatment, and the COMBO diet decreased it further. A similar pattern was observed for the ruminal molar proportion of propionate. The milk proportions of trans-10 18:1 and total trans FA dropped significantly with BFM or LM supplementation versus cows fed CTRL, and the COMBO diet decreased these variables further. Note, however, that these changes elicited by the COMBO diet were not in the same magnitude as those caused by MOL or BUF fed alone. The ruminal molar proportion of acetate increased with the BUF diet and that of butyrate increased in cows fed MOL, but mean ruminal pH was not affected by treatments. Diets with LM resulted in increased concentrations of short- and medium-chain FA in milk fat. The yield of 3.5% fat-corrected milk increased significantly in cows fed MOL or BUF due to the improved concentration of milk fat. A trend and a significant increase for energycorrected milk were observed with feeding MOL or BUF, respectively. Overall, inclusion of LM and BFM appears to reduce milk trans-10 18:1 FA and total trans FA by modulating ruminal pH and volatile FA profile in cows fed high-concentrate diets.

Methane emission, metabolism, and performance of Holstein dairy cows with low, medium, and high lymphocyte proliferation during transition	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						immune system; lymphocyte activation; mitogen; ruminant	PERIPHERAL-BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES; FUEL FEEDS FUNCTION; SHORT-COMMUNICATION; EARLY LACTATION; ENERGY-BALANCE; BODY CONDITION; GLUCOSE; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE; PERIPARTURIENT; RESPONSES	This study aimed to identify interactions between state of lactation (dry or early lactating) and immune responder group (low, medium, or high) for energy metabolism traits as well as metabolic and immunological traits in dairy cows. In early lactation, when the energy priority of cows shifts toward the mammary gland, the energy available to be partitioned toward the immune system may differ among individuals. The equilibrium between energy supply from feed, digestion, and body reserve mobilization and energy expenditure with milk, immune system, methane, and heat production is delicate in this stage. Seventeen Holstein cows entering their second to fifth lactation were kept under comparable feeding, housing, and management conditions and were studied from 14 +/- 6 d before calving to 11 +/- 3 d after calving. Feed intake, milk yield, body condition, blood metabolites, and cortisol as well as gaseous exchange in respiration chambers were measured. The latter was used to quantify methane emission and to calculate resting metabolic rate and heat production. Subsets of blood leukocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were monitored. Activation and proliferation of the PBMC in response to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin ante- and postpartum were assessed using the oxygen consumption rate (24-h cell culture assay) and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (72-h cell culture assay). Cows were classified based on the in vitro proliferative response of the PBMC measured postpartum in low (n = 6), medium (n = 5), and high (n = 6) responders. We found no interaction of state of lactation with responder group for feed intake, milk yield, efficiency, metabolic traits, and immune cell activation ante- and postpartum. However, after calving, low-responder cows produced less methane per unit of body weight and per unit of energy-corrected milk compared with the other cows. This might be indicative of a low rumen fermentation intensity. Low responders might therefore suffer from a lower availability of digestible energy in early lactation and not be able to sustain the shift from immune cell activation to proliferation. If so, the selection of environmentally friendly low-methane emitters could promote phenotypes with a compromised immune response in the critical early lactation.

Fifteen weeks antepartum, 38 pregnant multiparous Holstein cows were assigned to 2 groups that were fed differently to reach the targeted BCS and backfat thickness (BFT) until dry-off at -49 d before calving (HBCS: BCS >3.75 and BFT >1.4 cm; NBCS: <3.5 and <1.2 cm). Thereafter, both groups were fed identical diets. Blood samples and biopsies from the semitendinosus muscle were collected on d -49, 3, 21, and 84 relative to calving. Actual BCS at d -49 were 3.02 +/- 0.24 and 3.82 +/- 0.33 (mean +/- SD) for NBCS and HBCS, respectively. In both groups, serum profiles showed marked changes during the periparturient period, with decreasing concentrations of free carnitine and increasing concentrations of long-chain AcylCN. Compared with NBCS, HBCS had greater serum long-chain AcylCN in early lactation, which may point to an insufficient adaptation of their metabolism in response to the metabolic load of fatty acids around parturition. The muscle concentrations of C5-, C9-, C18:1-, and C18:2-AcylCN were lower and those of C14:2-AcylCN were greater in HBCS than in NBCS cows. The mRNA abundance of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)1, muscle isoform (CPT1b) and CPT2 increased from d -49 to early lactation (d 3, d 21), followed by a decline to nearly antepartum values by d 84; this change was not affected by group. In conclusion, over-conditioning around calving seems to be associated with mitochondrial overload, which can result in incomplete fatty acid oxidation in dairy cows.

Fifteen weeks before their anticipated calving date, 38 multiparous Holstein cows were selected based on their current and previous body condition scores (BCS) and allocated to either a high or a normal BCS group (19 cows each). They received different diets until dry-off to reach targeted differences in BCS and back fat thickness (BFT) until dry-off. At dry-off, normal BCS cows had a BCS <3.5 (minimum, 2.75) and BFT <1.2 cm (minimum, 0.58), and the high BCS cows had a BCS >3.75 (maximum, 4.50) and BFT >1.4 cm (maximum, 2.90). The proteomics study used a subset of 5 animals from each group. These cows were selected based on their circulating concentrations of fatty acids (FA) on d 14 postpartum and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on d 21 postpartum, representing the greater or the lower extreme values within their BCS group, respectively. The high BCS subset (HE-HBCS) had 4.50 < BCS > 3.75, FA = 1.17 +/- 0.46 mmol/L, and BHB = 2.15 +/- 0.42 mmol/L (means +/- SD), and the low BCS subset (LE-NBCS) had 3.50 < BCS > 2.75, FA = 0.51 +/- 0.28 mmol/L, and BHB = 0.84 +/- 0.17 mmol/L. Plasma samples from d -49, +7, and +21 relative to parturition were used for proteome profiling by applying the quantitative tandem mass tags (TMT) approach. Non-depleted plasma samples were subjected to reduction and digestion and then labeled with TMT 10plex reagents. High-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of TMT-labeled peptides was carried out, and the acquired spectra were analyzed for protein identification and quantification. In total, 254 quantifiable proteins (criteria: 2 unique peptides and 5% false discovery rate) were identified in the plasma samples. From these, 24 differentially abundant proteins (14 more abundant, 10 less abundant) were observed in the LE-NBCS cows compared with the HE-HBCS cows during the transition period. Plasma alpha-2-macroglobulins were more abundant in HE-HBCS versus LE-NBCS cows at d +7 and +21. Gene Ontology enrichment analyses of differentially abundant proteins revealed that the acute inflammatory response, regulation of complement activation, protein activation cascade, and regulation of humoral immune response were the most enriched terms in the LE-NBCS group compared with the HE-HBCS group. In addition, we identified 24 differentially abundant proteins (16 in the LE-NBCS group, and 8 in the HE-HBCS group) during the transition period. The complement components C1q and C5 were less abundant, while C3 and C3d were more abundant in LE-NBCS compared with HE-HBCS cows. Overall, overconditioning around calving was associated with alterations in protein pathways related to acute inflammatory response and regulation of complement and coagulation cascades in transition cows.

Design: Consensus meeting. Participants: An international panel of retina specialists, imaging and image reading center experts, and ocular pathologists. Methods: During several meetings organized under the auspices of the Macula Society, an international study group discussed and codified a set nomenclature framework for classifying the subtypes of neovascular AMD and associated lesion components. Main Outcome Measures: A consensus classification of neovascular AMD. Results: The study group created a standardized working definition of AMD. The components of neovascular AMD were defined and subclassified. Disease consequences of macular neovascularization were delineated. Conclusions: The framework of a consensus nomenclature system, a definition of AMD, and a delineation of the subtypes of neovascular AMD were developed. Establishing a uniform set of definitions will facilitate comparison of diverse patient groups and different studies. The framework presented is modified and updated readily, processes that are anticipated to occur on a periodic basis. The study group suggests that the consensus standards outlined in this article be used in future reported studies of neovascular AMD and clinical practice.

Feline followers and "umbrella carriers": Department Chairs' influence on faculty job satisfaction and quit intentions	RESEARCH POLICY			English	Article						Hybrid middle manager; Expert Leadership; "Umbrella Carrier"; Job satisfaction; Quit intentions; Department Chairs; Academics; Universities	HIGHER-EDUCATION; PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT; LIFE SATISFACTION; AGENCY-THEORY; LEADERSHIP; UNIVERSITY; IDENTITY; WORK; UK; ACADEMICS	Management quality at the department level is central to research and teaching performance in universities. This paper investigates the influence of department Chairs (hybrid middle managers) on faculty job satisfaction, satisfaction with job characteristics, and intentions to leave. Using UK and Swedish data, we provide the first evidence that faculty who rate their Chairs as being distinguished researchers report higher overall job satisfaction, satisfaction with job characteristics, and lower quit intentions. The perceived research strength of the Chair has the single largest statistical influence on faculty job satisfaction. This result holds after controlling for a large number of other influences and after employing a range of methods to correct for issues such as a potential single-rater bias. Although the primary contribution of this paper is empirical, we build on the expert leadership literature, appeal to social identity theory, and utilise the newly established concept of "umbrella carrier": we suggest that Chairs who are strong researchers may shelter subordinate faculty from excessive managerial spillovers, and protect academics' research time, thereby creating more favourable job characteristics. The paper's results highlight the benefits of good management in universities at a time when job satisfaction is in decline.

The "Salcher" landslide observatory-experimental long-term monitoring in the Flysch Zone of Lower Austria	BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Long-term landslide monitoring; Shallow rotational landslide; Slow moving landslide; Surface and subsurface monitoring techniques; Landslide structure; Rhenodanubian Flysch Zone; Terrestrial laser scanning; Inclinometer; Core drilling; Penetration test	SAR INTERFEROMETRY; TERRESTRIAL; DEFORMATION; CALIBRATION	Shallow landslide processes in geologically prone areas are recognised to pose threat to both human life and property. As precipitation is one of the main triggers for landslides, hydro-meteorological interrelationships and related future changes regarding frequency and magnitude of landslide processes in particular are of major interest. Long-term monitoring investigations of active landslide sites can provide a better understanding of the kinematic behaviour and triggering conditions of slope instabilities induced by hydro-meteorological patterns. In this study, we present the installation and first results of a long-term monitoring setup in the Flysch Zone of Lower Austria equipped with a large variety of combined hydrological and geotechnical measuring techniques. The geological unit of the Flysch Zone, characterised by high contents of clay and the corresponding weathering products, is exceptionally prone to earth and debris slides which are mostly triggered by heavy precipitation events or snow melting. The landslide under investigation is situated in the heterogeneous lithology of Flysch deposits, surrounded by private property and without any agricultural usage. There is evidence of landslide activity since the 1950s. As it is showing only moderate displacement velocities (max. 20 cm in 2009), it represents a predestined study site for a long-term monitoring and the testing of new monitoring techniques. One of the main aims of this study is to characterise the internal structure, assess the current landslide dynamics and to analyse recent process activity by means of surface and subsurface monitoring installations. Surface methods currently include terrestrial laser scanning, GNSS and total station measurements. With these, surface movement rates of approx. 12 cm/6 months have been detected in the most active part of the landslide. Inclinometer measurements together with results from core drillings and penetrations tests suggest a complex, rotational landslide system with different shear zones, consisting of a more active part in the upper 3 m underlain by a less active part down to 9-m depth. As this monitoring site is designed to be operated for at least 10 years, information about its structure and high-resolution, multi-temporal data about its dynamics can be correlated with hydrological cause variables in the future. These insights and the exemplary nature of the study site regarding shallow landslide processes in Flysch deposits will be useful for the development of novel analysis methods for both Lower Austria as well as study sites with similar initial conditions.

J	Nass, RD; Wagner, M; Surges, R; Holdenrieder, S				Nass, Robert D.; Wagner, Marcus; Surges, Rainer; Holdenrieder, Stefan			Time courses of HMGB1 and other inflammatory markers after generalized convulsive seizures	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						HMGB1; Seizures; Neuroinflammation; Blood brain barrier; CRP; Leukocytes	NEURON-SPECIFIC ENOLASE; ELECTROCONVULSIVE-THERAPY; SERUM-LEVELS; IMMUNE-SYSTEM; S-100 PROTEIN; EXERCISE; BLOOD; BIOMARKERS; DAMAGE	Purpose: Neuroinflammation and disruption of blood brain barrier (BBB) are important players in epileptogenesis, ictogenesis and pharmacoresistance. In this context, we investigated blood levels of HMGB1 and other inflammatory and BBB markers after generalized and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures in serum, summarized under the term generalized convulsive seizures (GCS). Methods: We included consenting adults who were admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and immediately after a GCS as well as after 2, 6 and 24 h. We measured leukocytes, c-reactive protein (CRP), the danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and S100, receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) alongside the BBB markers intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). Noradrenaline and lactate measurements were available from a previous study. P-levels < 0.05 were regarded as significant. Results: Twenty-eight patients with 28 GCS were included. Leukocytosis occurred immediately after GCS and normalized within two hours (p < 0.001). S100 and HMGB1 both increased by similar to 80 % (p < 0.001). MMP9 peaked after six hours with levels at 48.6 % above baseline. RAGE decreased by 17.6 % with a nadir at 24 h. CRP increased by 118 % with a peak at 24 h. ICAM1 remained stable (p = 0.068). Postictal HMGB1 correlated with postictal leukocytosis (r = 0.42; p = 0.025) and with MMP9 levels six hours later (r = 0.374; p = 0.05). Postictal lactate levels correlated with MMP9 at 6 h (r = 0.48; p = 0.01) and CRP at 24 h (r = 0.39; p = 0.04). Postictal noradrenaline correlated with lactate (r = 0.57; p = 0.02) and leukocytes (r = 0.39; p = 0.047). Discussion: The serum level of the DAMPs HMGB1 and S100 increase immediately after GCS. The hypothetical mechanism includes central nervous processes, such as glutamate toxicity and ROS release from seizing neurons but also muscular tissues. BBB breakdown is marked by the release of MMP9. Further research is needed to understand the complex interactions between electrical and metabolic stress, neuroinflammation and BBB mechanics in seizures and epilepsy. Conclusion: Our study reveals signs of inflammation, neuronal damage and transitory disruption of BBB following single GCS, underscoring the widespread and possibily detrimental effects of recurrent seizures on brain properties. The long term impact on the disease course, however, is unclear.

Motohashi's fourth moment identity for non-archimedean test functions and applications	COMPOSITIO MATHEMATICA			English	Article						spectral reciprocity; moments of L-functions; subconvexity	SUBCONVEXITY PROBLEM; MEAN-VALUE; KLOOSTERMAN SUMS; VALUES	Motohashi established an explicit identity between the fourth moment of the Riemann zeta function weighted by some test function and a spectral cubic moment of automorphic L-functions. By an entirely different method, we prove a generalization of this formula to a fourth moment of Dirichlet L-functions modulo q weighted by a non-archimedean test function. This establishes a new reciprocity formula. As an application, we obtain sharp upper bounds for the fourth moment twisted by the square of a Dirichlet polynomial of length q(1/4). An auxiliary result of independent interest is a sharp upper bound for a certain sixth moment for automorphic L-functions, which we also use to improve the best known subconvexity bounds for automorphic L-functions in the level aspect.

An empirical analysis for Indian states	ECONOMIC MODELLING			English	Article						Juvenile crime; Adult crime; Panel analysis; State income per capita; India	PROPERTY CRIME; PANEL-DATA; PUNISHMENT; PATTERNS; MITIGATE	While average juvenile crime rates across India has dropped in recent decades, juvenile property crime rates (total juvenile crimes divided by state population) has actually gone up from 15% in 2000-01 to about 20% in 2013-14. There is huge variation across states when it comes to juvenile crime rates. The literature on juvenile crime in the Indian context is scant. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by undertaking a comprehensive analysis of juvenile delinquency related to property crimes across Indian states. Results show that state income per capita has a non-linear impact on incidences of juvenile crime across Indian states - rising when the income starts growing for relatively poorer states but increasing at a diminishing rate when state income per capita rises further. When a poor state gets relatively richer, both opportunities to commit crime and returns from property crime increases. However, as the state grows even richer, growth of employment and state facilities including rehabilitation and redistribution, improve. Further, we find that states with the lowest income per capita and highest level of adult crime face the steepest increase in juvenile crime rates for a rise in state income per capita.

Specific relevant sources of bias are addressed: substitution effects on import demand, Tariff Rate Quotas and overprotection in tariffs. The aggregators are linked to a global large-scale partial equilibrium model and benchmarked against a standard aggregator. The choice of the aggregation method shows considerable effects on simulated economic impacts, specifically if the dispersion in tariffs or tariff cuts is large. A large bias is revealed in simulated gains from trade liberalisation using the standard aggregator. The impacts on traded quantities are found to be overestimated, while price and welfare effects can be higher or lower by switching to alternative aggregation methods. By reducing aggregation bias and depicting negotiated tariff schedules more directly, the proposed aggregators enhance the contribution of trade modelling to evidence-based policy making.

J	Troger, K; Lelea, MA; Hensel, O; Kaufmann, B				Troeger, Katharine; Lelea, Margareta Amy; Hensel, Oliver; Kaufmann, Brigitte			Re-framing post-harvest losses through a situated analysis of the pineapple value chain in Uganda	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Food value chains; Food waste; Post-harvest losses; Systems approach; Global South; Pineapple	FOOD WASTE; CONVENTION THEORY; SYSTEMS THINKING; QUALITY; STANDARDS; NETWORKS; MARKET; TECHNOLOGIES; TRANSITIONS; INSIGHTS	Post-harvest loss (PHL) assessments are usually commodity-oriented and approaches for reducing these losses tend to rely on technological interventions for improving product handling and quality. However, such narrow problem framing neglects the situatedness of PHL, particularly when perishable crops of heterogeneous quality are traded through networks of small-scale value chain actors, as is common in the Global South. To illustrate our critique, we lean on systems as a conceptual construct to unpack PHL with the empirical example of the pineapple value chain in Uganda. Specifically, we aim (i) at surfacing multiple actors' perspectives related to the spectrum of losses and (ii) to improve understanding of their strategies to deal with related problems. We draw from participant observation, semi-structured interviews and group meetings with farmers, brokers, traders and interlinked actors such as small-scale processors and pig farmers. Our study shows how they navigate existing resource constraints and how their practices to recover potential food losses are embedded in their local food systems. The contextualized understandings of quality and the consequences of what can be considered a loss, challenge dominant narratives about high levels of PHL in Sub-Saharan Africa. Extending system boundaries beyond the fresh-fruit value chain revealed how interlinked actors were able to benefit from using 'damaged' fruits. Our findings encourage going beyond generic quality systems towards more diverse understandings of quality and loss. Investigating losses in a systemic and context-specific way can put local perspectives at the forefront to encourage actor-driven approaches for sustainable PHL reduction.

Our purpose is to find the most adequate experimental conditions to detect CB1 by WB and immunoprecipitation (IP) as a first step towards the study of CB1 interactome. New method: We use CB1 knockout mice tissue as negative controls and describe appropriate sample handling conditions for CB1 detection by WB and IP from brain and cortical neuron cultures. Results: Sample heating above 65 degrees C greatly impaired CB1 detection by WB, since it favored the formation of high molecular weight aggregates. We also show the convenience of using n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside (DDM) as a detergent for the detection of CB1 by WB and, mostly, for IP. Comparison with existing method(s): We obtain consistent and specific CB1 detection by WB and IP using four different commercial antibodies and KO tissue for an accurate CB1 identification. We clarify the identification of the receptor in complex samples compared with the diverse and unclear results obtained using standard WB methods. Conclusions: We establish experimental guidelines for the detection of CB1 by WB and the study of CB1 interacting proteins by IP. We propose a new interpretation of CB1 WB and IP data based on the folding and packing	[Esteban, Pedro F.; Garcia-Ovejero, Daniel; Paniagua-Torija, Beatriz; Moreno-Luna, Rafael; Arevalo Martin, Angel; Molina-Holgado, Eduardo] Hosp Nacl Paraplej SESCAM, Lab Neuroinflammat, Finca Peraleda S-N, E-45071 Toledo, Spain; [Arredondo, Luis F.] Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Dept Bioquim, San Luis Potosi, San Luis Potosi, Mexico; [Zimmer, Andreas] Univ Bonn, Inst Mol Psychiat, Bonn, Germany	Molina-Holgado, E (reprint author), Hosp Nacl Paraplej SESCAM, Lab Neuroinflammat, Finca Peraleda S-N, E-45071 Toledo, Spain.	eduardom@sescam.jccm.es	Molina-Holgado, Eduardo/C-2714-2008	Molina-Holgado, Eduardo/0000-0001-6693-1682; Esteban, Pedro/0000-0002-8760-7512	Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of Spain - FEDER-European Union [SAF2015-69927]	Funded by the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of Spain, Grant ID SAF2015-69927 (cofunded by FEDER-European Union) to EMH and DGO.		48	0	0	0	0	ELSEVIER	AMSTERDAM	RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0165-0270	1872-678X		J NEUROSCI METH	J.

Prospective studies on best anesthetic management are missing, partially due to different standards. The aim of the present study was to survey the current standard practice in anesthetic management in pediatric cardiac surgical centers in Germany. Methods: All 78 cardiac surgical centers in Germany were reviewed for a congenital cardiac surgery program. Centers with an active program for congenital cardiac surgery were interviewed to participate in the present online questionnaire to assess their current anesthetic practice. Results: Twenty-seven German centers running an active program for congenital heart surgery were identified, covering more than 3,000 pediatric cardiac surgeries annually. Of these centers, 96.3% (26/27) participated in our survey. Standard induction agents were etomidate in 26.9% (7/26), propofol in 19.2% (5/26), a combination of benzodiazepines and ketamine in 19.2% (5/26), and barbiturates in 11.5% (3/26). General anesthesia was preferentially maintained using volatile agents, 61.5% (16/26), with sevoflurane being the most common volatile agent within this group, 81.2% (13/16). Intraoperative first-choice/first-line inotropic drug was epinephrine, 53.8% (14/26), followed by milrinone, 23.1% (6/26), and dobutamine 15.4% (4/26). Fast-track programs performing on-table extubation depending on the type of surgical procedure were established at 61.5% (16/26) of the centers. Conclusion: This study highlights the diversity of clinical standards in pediatric cardiac anesthesia for congenital cardiac surgery in Germany.

Arterial Wall Inflammation and Increased Hematopoietic Activity in Patients With Primary Aldosteronism	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM			English	Article						primary aldosteronism; inflammation; atherosclerosis; immune system; mineralocorticoid; F-18-FDG PET-CT	MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; MONOCYTE; RECEPTOR; MACROPHAGE; PREDICTOR; RATIO; RISK	Context: Primary aldosteronism (PA) confers an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of blood pressure. Animal models have shown that aldosterone accelerates atherosclerosis through proinflammatory changes in innate immune cells; human data are scarce. Objective: The objective of this article is to explore whether patients with PA have increased arterial wall inflammation, systemic inflammation, and reprogramming of monocytes. Design: A cross-sectional cohort study compared vascular inflammation on 2'-deoxy-2'-(F-18) fluoro-D-glucose; (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography, systemic inflammation, and monocyte phenotypes and transcriptome between PA patients and controls. Setting: This study took place at Radboudumc and Rijnstate Hospital, the Netherlands. Patients: Fifteen patients with PA and 15 age-, sex-, and blood pressure-matched controls with essential hypertension (EHT) participated. Main Outcome Measures and Results: PA patients displayed a higher arterial F-18-FDG uptake in the descending and abdominal aorta (P <.01, P <.05) and carotid and iliac arteries (both P <.01). In addition, bone marrow uptake was higher in PA patients (P <.05). Although PA patients had a higher monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (P <.05), systemic inflammatory markers, cytokine production capacity, and transcriptome of circulating monocytes did not differ. Monocyte-derived macrophages from PA patients expressed more TNFA; monocyte-derived macrophages of healthy donors cultured in PA serum displayed increased interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a production. Conclusions: Because increased arterial wall inflammation is associated with accelerated atherogenesis and unstable plaques, this might importantly contribute to the increased CVD risk in PA patients. We did not observe inflammatory reprogramming of circulating monocytes. However, subtle inflammatory changes are present in the peripheral blood cell composition and monocyte transcriptome of PA patients, and in their monocyte-derived macrophages. Most likely, arterial inflammation in PA requires interaction between various cell types.	[van der Heijden, Charlotte D. C.

J	Vogt, M; Linton, O				Vogt, Michael; Linton, Oliver			Multiscale clustering of nonparametric regression curves	JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS			English	Article						Clustering of nonparametric curves; Nonparametric regression; Multiscale statistics; Multiple time series	PANEL-DATA MODELS; GROUPED PATTERNS; FRAGMENTATION; INFERENCE; MARKET	In a wide range of modern applications, one observes a large number of time series rather than only a single one. It is often natural to suppose that there is some group structure in the observed time series. When each time series is modeled by a nonparametric regression equation, one may in particular assume that the observed time series can be partitioned into a small number of groups whose members share the same nonparametric regression function. We develop a bandwidth-free clustering method to estimate the unknown group structure from the data. More precisely speaking, we construct multiscale estimators of the unknown groups and their unknown number which are free of classical bandwidth or smoothing parameters. In the theoretical part of the paper, we analyze the statistical properties of our estimators. Our theoretical results are derived under general conditions which allow the data to be dependent both in time series direction and across different time series. The technical analysis of the paper is complemented by simulated and real-data examples. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to evaluate facial nerve outcomes based on surgical techniques, tumour size, and immunohistochemical factors. Methods One hundred eighteen patients with VS were retrospectively analysed. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 83 patients, and subtotal resection (STR) was achieved in 35 patients. Follow-up was 60 months (median). Facial nerve outcomes were assessed for 24 months after surgery. Analysis of the MIB-1 index was performed in 114 patients (97%) to evaluate recurrence and facial nerve outcomes. Results Immediately after surgery, 16 of 35 patients (45.7%) with STR and 21 of 83 patients (25.3%) with GTR had a good (House-Brackmann (HB) score <= 2) facial nerve outcome (p = 0.029). Semi-sitting positioning (p = 0.002) and tumour size class of 3 (> 4 cm) were also associated with worse HB outcomes after 2 years (p = 0.004) in univariate analyses. The MIB-1 index was significantly correlated with diffuse infiltration of tumour-associated CD45(+) lymphocytes (r = 0.63, p = 0.015) and CD68(+) macrophages (r = 0.43, p = 0.021). ROC analysis found an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI = 0.60-0.86, p = 0.003) for the MIB-1 index in predicting poor facial nerve outcomes. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed an MIB-1 index >= 5% (16/28 (57.1%) vs. 5/40 (12.5%); p < 0.001, OR = 14.0, 95% CI = 3.2-61.1) and a tumour size class of 3 (6/8 (75.0%) vs. 2/8 (25.0%); p = 0.01, OR = 14.56, 95% CI = 1.9-113.4) were predictors of poor HB scores (>= 3) after 1 year. Conclusions An MIB-1 index >= 5% seems to predict worse long-term facial nerve outcomes in VS surgery.

This paper introduces a framework for guiding a transdisciplinary diagnostic approach (i.e. a context-sensitive assessment of multi-level water governance, which is combined with a change management process) to address such coordination problems. The approach aims at addressing some of the challenges identified in scientific scholarship and water governance practice by combining context-specific participatory assessments of individual cases with comparative case analysis guided by a generic conceptual framework. The focus is on implementation processes at regional and local scale and their embedding in a mull-level water governance system and a specific environmental and societal context. A coherent approach and formalized representation across individual cases is essential to develop cumulative knowledge and to improve the diagnostic strength of the approach. Based on a broad literature review and exploratory study of multiple, diverse cases conceptual framework identifies a variety of factors that are expected to be important for understanding the performance of environmental governance and management systems. The paper makes explicit the hypotheses on relationships between core variables that resulted from framework development. The framework, including the collection of hypotheses, offers a structured approach for analysing a phenomenon as complex and multi-facetted as coordination. It allows identification of multiple pathways that may lead an improvement or a decline in performance, respectively. The framework can find more widespread application in supporting comparative case study analyses with a focus on improving the understanding of policy implementation also beyond the field of water governance and management.

Our aim was to evaluate the use and impact of pre-implantation balloon aortic valvuloplasty (pre-BAV) before transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with Acurate neo. The NEOPRO Registry retrospectively included 1,263 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI with Acurate neo at 18 centers between January 2012 and March 2018. Information on pre-BAV was available for 1,262 patients (99.9%). Primary end points were pre-discharge moderate-to-severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PAR II+), 30-day new permanent pacemaker implantation, and 30-day all-cause mortality or stroke. A total of 1,262 patients who underwent TAVI with (n = 1,051) or without predilatation (n = 211) were included. A reduction in the pre-BAV rate was observed during the study period (from 95.7% in the first date quintile to 78.4% in the last date quintile). Patients who underwent preBAV had higher degrees of aortic valve (AV) and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) calcification. Primary endpoints were similar between pre-BAV and no preBAV groups (PAR II+ 5.5% vs 3.4%, p = 0.214; 30-day permanent pacemaker implantation 9.0% vs 8.0%, p = 0.660; 30-day death or stroke 4.9% vs 4.4%, p = 0.743). The need for postdilatation and other procedural outcomes were comparable between groups. Predilatation did not have a significant impact on primary endpoints across AV and LVOT calcification subgroups (subgroup analyses) and was not independently associated with primary endpoints (multivariate analyses). In conclusion, transfemoral Acurate neo implantation without predilatation appears to be feasible and safe, especially in patients with milder degrees of AV and LVOT calcification.

Assessing the sensitivity and repeatability of permanganate oxidizable carbon as a soil health metric: An interlab comparison across soils	GEODERMA			English	Article							ORGANIC-MATTER; SOLUTION RATIO; FRACTIONS; OXIDATION; MANAGEMENT; CONFIDENCE; TURNOVER; NITROGEN; INDEX	Soil organic matter is central to the soil health framework. Therefore, reliable indicators of changes in soil organic matter are essential to inform land management decisions. Permanganate oxidizable carbon (PDXC), an emerging soil health indicator, has shown promise for being sensitive to soil management. However, strict standardization is required for widespread implementation in research and commercial contexts. Here, we used 36 soils-three from each of the 12 USDA soil orders-to determine the effects of sieve size and soil mass of analysis on PDXC results. Using replicated measurements across 12 labs in the US and the EU (n = 7951 samples), we quantified the relative importance of 1) variation between labs, 2) variation within labs, 3) effect soil mass, and 4) effect of soil sieve size on the repeatability of PDXC. We found a wide range of overall variability in PDXC values across labs (0.03 to 171.8%; mean = 13.4%), and much of this variability was attributable to within-lab variation (median = 6.5%) independently of soil mass or sieve size. Greater soil mass (2.5 g) decreased absolute PDXC values by a mean of 177 mg kg(-1 )soil and decreased analytical variability by 6.5%. For soils with organic carbon (SOC) >10%, greater soil mass (2.5 g) resulted in more frequent PDXC values above the limit of detection whereas the lower soil mass (0.75 g) resulted in PDXC values below the limit of detection for SOC contents <5%. A finer sieve size increased absolute values of PDXC by 124 mg kg(-1) while decreasing the analytical variability by 1.8%. In general, soils with greater SOC contents had lower analytical variability. These results point to potential standardizations of the PDXC protocol that can decrease the variability of the metric. We recommend that the PDXC protocol be standardized to use 2.5 g for soils <10% SOC. Sieve size was a relatively small contributor to analytical variability and therefore we recommend that this decision be tailored to the study purpose.

We used a random sample of 250 000 patients at age 50+ years of the register of the Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse from 2004 to 2015. Selected manifestations of venous diseases assumed as risk factors for mortality were analyzed using Cox models while adjusting for various basic demographic and health characteristics. The prevalence in 2004 was 0.05% for DVT of the femoral veins, 0.50% for DVT of any deep veins, 0.86% for PTS, and 0.91% for VLU. The mortality rate in 2004 to 2015 was 20.40 deaths/100 person-years for DVT of the femoral veins, 10.69 for DVT of any deep veins, 4.34 for PTS, and 7.02 for VLU. The model revealed a 35% higher risk (p < .001) in patients with any DVT, an 88% higher mortality (p < .001) for femoral DVT, a 23% higher risk (p < .001) for VLU, and no health disadvantage in persons with PTS. Our study revealed an increased mortality for patients with VLU and DVT. Even after adjustment for embolic events and infections of the venous ulcers mortality remained significantly higher.

J	Thomas, A; Thevis, M				Thomas, Andreas; Thevis, Mario			Identification of metabolites of peptide-derived drugs using an isotope-labeled reporter ion screening strategy	CLINICAL CHEMISTRY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE			English	Article						doping; high-resolution mass spectrometry; immonium ions; peptide metabolism	TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; IN-VITRO METABOLISM; IMMUNOAFFINITY PURIFICATION; HUMAN INSULIN; HORMONES; ANALOGS; TIME	Background: Peptide-derived drugs represent an emerging class of prohibited substances in professional sports and, thus, in modern doping controls. After parental administration (e.g. subcutaneous, intravenous), these drugs undergo various metabolic processes, which degrade them to biologically active or inactive peptides. Knowledge about these metabolic processes and the hereby produced metabolites plays a key role in successful doping controls due to the effective design of analytical assays under consideration of optimal analytical targets. Unfortunately, the complexity of biological matrix (e.g. blood or urine) complicates the immediate identification of relevant metabolites due to the enormous excess of naturally occurring peptides and their degradation products. Methods: In this study, a strategy employing in-vitro metabolism of stable isotope-labeled peptides producing characteristic reporter ions derived from labeled immonium ions is shown. The in-vitro experiments were performed with human skin tissue microsomes (S9), and model drugs representing prohibited peptide hormones were synacthen, insulin, and corticorelin (respectively, their stable isotope-labeled analogs). After generic sample preparation, the metabolites were identified by means of liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) in an untargeted approach. Results and conclusions: For all three model peptides, several metabolic products were readily identified. While insulin and corticorelin were found to be comparably stable, synacthen was fully degraded, yielding a plethora of metabolic products. A proof of concept concerning the transferability of the obtained data was accomplished by analyzing plasma samples collected post-administration of recombinant human insulin, corroborating the presence of a skin protease-indicative insulin metabolite in vivo.

J	Schmid, M; Welchowski, T; Wright, MN; Berger, M				Schmid, Matthias; Welchowski, Thomas; Wright, Marvin N.; Berger, Moritz			Discrete-time survival forests with Hellinger distance decision trees	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Class imbalance; Discrete event times; Hellinger's distance; Random survival forests; Recursive partitioning; Survival analysis	VARIABLE SELECTION; PREDICTION; RULES	Random survival forests (RSF) are a powerful nonparametric method for building prediction models with a time-to-event outcome. RSF do not rely on the proportional hazards assumption and can be readily applied to both low- and higher-dimensional data. A remaining limitation of RSF, however, arises from the fact that the method is almost entirely focussed on continuously measured event times. This issue may become problematic in studies where time is measured on a discrete scale t=1,2,...\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$t = 1, 2, ...$$\end{document}, referring to time intervals [0,a1),[a1,a2), horizontal ellipsis \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$[0,a_1), [a_1,a_2), \ldots $$\end{document}. In this situation, the application of methods designed for continuous time-to-event data may lead to biased estimators and inaccurate predictions if discreteness is ignored. To address this issue, we develop a RSF algorithm that is specifically designed for the analysis of (possibly right-censored) discrete event times. The algorithm is based on an ensemble of discrete-time survival trees that operate on transformed versions of the original time-to-event data using tree methods for binary classification. As the outcome variable in these trees is typically highly imbalanced, our algorithm implements a node splitting strategy based on Hellinger's distance, which is a skew-insensitive alternative to classical split criteria such as the Gini impurity. The new algorithm thus provides flexible nonparametric predictions of individual-specific discrete hazard and survival functions. Our numerical results suggest that node splitting by Hellinger's distance improves predictive performance when compared to the Gini impurity. Furthermore, discrete-time RSF improve prediction accuracy when compared to RSF approaches treating discrete event times as continuous in situations where the number of time intervals is small.

The goal was to mitigate the decrease in vessel profits due to the rise of gasoline prices. Estimations are conducted from transaction data over the 2009-2011 period during which the innovation was introduced. Using a difference-in-differences approach around the discontinuity, we find that the innovation has a large positive effect on quality, prices and profit of treated vessels. However, a shift in caught fish species is observed and new targeted species are fished very intensively. This suggests that quota management is needed to ensure the sustainability of fishing practices involving the new technology in the long run.

Methods This was a retrospective sample analysis representing hospitals and office-based physicians in Germany in 2016. Records from lung, breast, and prostate cancer patients who had received a diagnosis of bone metastasis between April 1, 2015, and March 31, 2016, were included. Oncologists at participating centers answered a self-assessment survey on aspects related to their professional life, including guideline adherence and years of clinical experience in medical oncology. Guideline adherence rates were assessed from patient records. Treatment variables and survey data were used to identify predictors of guideline compliance in a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. Results Disregarding recommendations for supplementation of calcium and vitamin D, guideline adherence among physicians treating lung, breast, or prostate cancer patients was 62%, 92%, and 83%, respectively. Compliance was 15%, 42%, and 40% if recommendations for dietary supplements were taken into account. Identified predictors of guideline compliance included treatment setting, medical specialty, years of professional experience, and frequency of quality circle attendance. Conclusions Compliance with the ESMO and the German guidelines in cancer patients varies between medical specialties. In particular, patients with lung cancer and bone metastases often do not receive the recommended osteoprotective treatment and required supplementation. Discrepancies between guideline recommendations and common practice should be addressed with dedicated training.

Here we elucidate a Mechanism of CAM-DR in breast cancer cells in vitro. We show that human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells decrease their sensitivity towards cisplatin, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone cytotoxicity upon binding to collagen type 1 (COL1) or fibronectin (FN). The intracellular concentrations of doxorubicin and mitoxantrone were decreased upon cell cultivation on COL1, while cellular cisplatin levels remained unaffected. Since doxorubicin and mitoxantrone are transporter substrates, this refers to ATP binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporter activities. The activation of the transporters BCRP, P-gp and MRP1 was shown by fluorescence assays to distinguish the individual input of these transporters to resistance in presence of COL1 and related to their expression levels by western blot. An ABC transporter inhibitor was able to re-sensitize COLT-treated cells for doxorubicin and mitoxantrone toxicity. Antibody-blocking of beta(1)-integrin (ITGB1) induced sensitization towards the indicated cytostatic drugs by attenuating the increased ABC efflux activity. This refers to a key role of ITGB1 for matrix binding and subsequent transporter activation. A downregulation of alpha(2)beta(1) integrin following COL1 binding appears as clear indication for the relationship between ITGB1 and ABC transporters in regulating resistance formation, while knockdown of ITGB1 leads to a significant upregulation of all three transporters. Our data provide evidence for a role of CAM-DR in breast cancer via an ITGB1 - transporter axis and offer promising therapeutic targets for cancer sensitization.

Minimizing distortions with sectored GEM electrodes	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						GEM; Sectorization; Sectors; Distortions; DLC	DETECTOR; CONSTRUCTION	Electrode sectorization is an important design principle for large area GEM based detectors. It reduces the energy of discharges and permits to disconnect defective or shorted sectors, but induces a local signal distortion and a potential efficiency loss. We implemented and evaluated a new design approach for the insulating gaps between electrode sectors, to minimize or mitigate distortions and dead regions. By preserving the hole pattern of GEMs even in the insulating region between electrode sectors, the response of the detector in these regions was partly recovered resulting in reduced distortions. Single-side sectored GEMs were optically read out to study the influence of different sectorization patterns. Recorded images show a clear improvement with full holes both aligned with the rows and with a random alignment as compared to the traditional blank insulating strip between sectors. A sectored GEM manufactured on a substrate coated with a resistive DLC layer was evaluated and shown to minimize distortions. The investigated sectorization patterns provide a way of recovering signals in the insulating or resistive regions between sectors in GEM-based detectors.	[Marques, A. P.; Brunbauer, F.

Multiple mineral horizons in layered outcrops at Mawrth Vallis, Mars, signify changing geochemical environments on early Mars	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Mineralogy; Spectroscopy; Aqueous processes; Salt; Climate	DIOCTAHEDRAL SMECTITES; EMISSION-SPECTROSCOPY; MICROBIAL REDUCTION; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; CLAY-MINERALS; SALINE LAKES; ACID; REGION; SURFACE; FE	Refined calibrations of CRISM images are enabling identification of smaller deposits of unique aqueous materials on Mars that reveal changing environmental conditions at the region surrounding Mawrth Vallis. Through characterization of these clay-sulfate assemblages and their association with the layered, phyllosilicate units of this region, more details of the aqueous geochemical history can be gleaned. A stratigraphy including five distinct mineral horizons is mapped using compositional data from CRISM over CTX and HRSC imagery across 100s of km and from CRISM over HiRISE imagery across 100s of meters. Transitions in mineralogic units were characterized using visible/near-infrared (VNIR) spectral properties and surface morphology. We identified and characterized complex "doublet" type spectral signatures with two bands between 2.2 and 2.3 mu m at one stratigraphic horizon. Based on comparisons with terrestrial sites, the spectral "doublet" unit described here may reflect the remnants of a salty, evaporative period that existed on Mars during the transition from formation of Fe-rich phyllosilicates to Al-rich phyllosilicates. Layered outcrops observed at Mawrth Vallis are thicker than in other altered regions of Mars, but may represent processes that were more widespread in wet regions of the planet during its early history. The aqueous geochemical environments supporting the outcrops observed here include: (i) the formation of Fe3+-rich smectites in a warm and wet environment, (ii) overlain by a thin ferrousbearing clay unit that could be associated with heating or reducing conditions, (iii) followed by a transition to salty and/or acidic alteration phases and sulfates (characterized by the spectral "doublet" shape) in an evaporative setting, (iv) formation of Al-rich phyllosilicates through pedogenesis or acid leaching, and (v) finally persistence of poorly crystalline aluminosilicates marking the end of the warm climate on early Mars. The "doublet" type units described here are likely composed of clay-sulfate assemblages formed in saline, acidic evaporative environments similar to those found in Western Australia and the Atacama desert. Despite the chemically extreme and variable waters present at these terrestrial, saline lake environments, active ecosystems are present; thus, these "doublet" type units may mark exciting areas for continued exploration important to astrobiology on Mars.

A low-cost, rapid and objective alternative is digital image analysis. Here we report the development of an image analysis method for quantification of iridescence in meat products. Two segmentation techniques (global thresholding and k-means clustering algorithm) were tested for their capability to divide images into segments of iridescent and non-iridescent areas. Images segmented using k-means clustering algorithm resulted in slightly higher iridescent areas than images segmented with global thresholding (mean difference of 1.24%) but no significant difference (P > .05) between the iridescent areas calculated by both methods was observed. Almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.800, p = .001) was observed between the image analysis and the visual evaluation. The results from this study showed that digital image analysis is an effective tool for evaluating surface iridescence in meat and meat products.

J	Brandi, C; Schwab, J; Berger, A; Morin, JF				Brandi, Clara; Schwab, Jakob; Berger, Axel; Morin, Jean-Frederic			Do environmental provisions in trade agreements make exports from developing countries greener?	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						International trade; Environment; Developing countries; preferential trade agreements (PTAs); Pollution haven hypothesis; Porter hypothesis	SAMPLE SELECTION; LIBERALIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY; STANDARDS; IMPACT; POLICY; COMPETITIVENESS; INNOVATION; POLLUTION; DESIGN	Environmental provisions in preferential trade agreements (PTAs) are increasing in terms of their number and variety. The economic effects of these environmental provisions remain largely unclear. It is, therefore, necessary to determine whether the trend to incorporate environmental provisions in PTAs counteracts the goal to spur economic development through trade via these PTAs. This is the first article in which the trade effects of environmental provisions in PTAs are thoroughly investigated. The spotlight is put on developing countries for which the assumed trade-off between economic development and environmental protection is particularly acute. This article uses a new fine-grained dataset on a broad range of environmental provisions in 680 PTAs, combined with a panel of worldwide bilateral trade flows from 1984 to 2016. We show that environmental provisions can help reduce dirty exports and increase green exports from developing countries. This effect is particularly pronounced in developing countries with stringent environmental regulations. By investigating how environmental provisions in PTAs affect trade flows, this article contributes to the literature on the following topics: international trade and the environment; design and impacts of trade agreements; and greening the economy in developing countries. It also shows that the design of trade agreements matters. Environmental provisions can be used as targeted policy tools to promote the green transformation and to leverage synergies between the economic and environmental effects of including environmental provisions in trade agreements.

J	Glaubitz, J; Offner, P				Glaubitz, Jan; Offner, Philipp			Stable discretisations of high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods on equidistant and scattered points	APPLIED NUMERICAL MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Hyperbolic conservation laws; High-order methods; Discontinuous Galerkin methods; Scattered nodes; Discrete least squares; Numerical integration; Discrete orthogonal polynomials	FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; CONSERVATION-LAWS; SUMMATION; PARTS; SCHEMES; DISCRETIZATION; APPROXIMATION; STABILITY; PROJECTIONS; DISCRETE	In this work, we propose and investigate stable high-order collocation-type discretisations of the discontinuous Galerkin method on equidistant and scattered collocation points. We do so by incorporating the concept of discrete least squares into the discontinuous Galerkin framework. Discrete least squares approximations allow us to construct stable and high-order accurate approximations on arbitrary collocation points, while discrete least squares quadrature rules allow us their stable and exact numerical integration. Both methods are computed efficiently by using bases of discrete orthogonal polynomials. Thus, the proposed discretisation generalises known classes of discretisations of the discontinuous Galerkin method, such as the discontinuous Galerkin collocation spectral element method. We are able to prove conservation and linear L-2-stability of the proposed discretisations. Finally, numerical tests investigate their accuracy and demonstrate their extension to nonlinear conservation laws, systems, longtime simulations, and a variable coefficient problem in two space dimensions.

In this paper, we elicit the revealed willingness to pay for different solar technologies in rural Rwanda. Households are willing to dedicate substantial parts of their budget to electricity, but not enough to reach cost-covering prices. Randomly extended payment periods do not alter this finding. We interpret the results from two perspectives. First, we examine whether the United Nations' universal energy access goal can be reached via unsubsidized markets. Second, in a stylized welfare analysis, we compare a subsidization policy for off-grid solar electrification to a grid extension policy. Our findings suggest that off-grid solar is the preferable technology to reach mass electrification in rural areas and that grid infrastructure should concentrate on selected regions with promising business prospects.

J	Vogelsang, A; Eckhardt, J; Mendez, D; Berger, M				Vogelsang, Andreas; Eckhardt, Jonas; Mendez, Daniel; Berger, Moritz			Views on quality requirements in academia and practice: commonalities, differences, and context-dependent grey areas	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Quality requirements; Non-functional requirements; Context factors; Requirements engineering; Survey; Eempirical study		Context Quality requirements (QRs) are a topic of constant discussions both in industry and academia. Debates entwine around the definition of quality requirements, the way how to handle them, or their importance for project success. While many academic endeavors contribute to the body of knowledge about QRs, practitioners may have different views. In fact, we still lack a consistent body of knowledge on QRs since much of the discussion around this topic is still dominated by observations that are strongly context-dependent. This holds for both academic and practitioners' views. Our assumption is that, in consequence, those views may differ. Objective: We report on a study to better understand the extent to which available research statements on quality requirements, as found in exemplary peer-reviewed and frequently cited publications, are reflected in the perception of practitioners. Our goal is to analyze differences, commonalities, and context-dependent grey areas in the views of academics and practitioners to allow a discussion on potential misconceptions (on either sides) and opportunities for future research. Method: We conducted a survey with 109 practitioners to assess whether they agree with research statements about QRs reflected in the literature. Based on a statistical model, we evaluate the impact of a set of context factors to the perception of research statements. Results: Our results show that a majority of the statements is well respected by practitioners; however, not all of them. When examining the different groups and backgrounds of respondents, we noticed interesting deviations of perceptions within different groups that may lead to new research questions. Conclusions:Our results help identifying prevalent context-dependent differences about how academics and practitioners view QRs and pinpointing statements where further research might be useful.

High-dimensional regression in practice: an empirical study of finite-sample prediction, variable selection and ranking	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Simulation study; High-dimensional regression; Penalized regression; Lasso; Variable selection; Prediction	NONCONCAVE PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD; DANTZIG SELECTOR; STATISTICAL ESTIMATION; MODEL SELECTION; LASSO; REGULARIZATION; SPARSITY; LARGER	Penalized likelihood approaches are widely used for high-dimensional regression. Although many methods have been proposed and the associated theory is now well developed, the relative efficacy of different approaches in finite-sample settings, as encountered in practice, remains incompletely understood. There is therefore a need for empirical investigations in this area that can offer practical insight and guidance to users. In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of penalized regression methods. We distinguish between three related goals: prediction, variable selection and variable ranking. Our results span more than 2300 data-generating scenarios, including both synthetic and semisynthetic data (real covariates and simulated responses), allowing us to systematically consider the influence of various factors (sample size, dimensionality, sparsity, signal strength and multicollinearity). We consider several widely used approaches (Lasso, Adaptive Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge Regression, SCAD, the Dantzig Selector and Stability Selection). We find considerable variation in performance between methods. Our results support a "no panacea" view, with no unambiguous winner across all scenarios or goals, even in this restricted setting where all data align well with the assumptions underlying the methods. The study allows us to make some recommendations as to which approaches may be most (or least) suitable given the goal and some data characteristics. Our empirical results complement existing theory and provide a resource to compare methods across a range of scenarios and metrics.

Biologically active soils have the ability to suppress pathogenic infections of plants, but little is known how this essential soil function might be affected by abiotic stresses. Using a model system with pea and its fungal pathogen Pythium ultimum we studied how the suppressiveness of different soils from a wide geographic range responds to combined heat and drought stress. We found that different soils strongly differ in their ability to suppress diseases and that a stress event of combined heat (40 degrees C) and drought (-50% moisture) can strongly reduce this disease suppressiveness. Further, the response of suppressiveness to the stress depended on the provenance of the soil. Soils from a cool-climate site in Scotland were much more negatively affected than soils from warmer sites in Germany and Hungary. After being exposed to stress, one soil was able to regain suppressiveness after several weeks while the others were not, thereby collectively showing different degrees of resilience to the stress. Stress tolerance was negatively related to resilience. Our results suggest that microbial communities responsible for suppressiveness are adapted to prevailing climate, which has potentially severe consequences for the impact of climate change upon plant health.

Objective: We sought to determine the association between preoperative anticholinergic load calculated using the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) and POD in cancer patients over 65 years of age. Design: A retrospective sub-investigation of a randomised controlled interventional trial. Setting: Two tertiary university hospitals. Patients: Overall, patients aged 65 years and older scheduled for surgical treatment of gasffointestinary, genitourinary or gynaecological cancers. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the interaction between anticholinergic drug scale and occurrence of postoperative delirium. Patient clinical parameters and ADS scores were assessed preoperatively. POD screening was conducted for a total of 7 days following surgery using validated measures. Independent associations between ADS and POD were assessed using multivariate logistical regression analyses. Results: A total of 651 patients (mean age, 71.8 years; 68.5% males) were included. Of those, 66 patients (10.1%) developed POD. The ADS score was independently associated with the occurrence of POD (higher ADS per point OR 1.496; 95% CI 1.09-2.05; p = 0.01). Additionally, age (per year OR 1.06; CI 95% CI 1.01-1.11; p = 0.03) and ASA state (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.22-3.83; p = 0.01), as well as stay on ICU (yes vs. no OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.57-4.998; p < 0.01), were independently associated with POD. Conclusions: ADS assessment according to chronic medication use is a cost-effective, non-invasive method of identifying elderly cancer patients at risk for POD.

Over the last decades, seaweed-derived constituents turned out to not only reside in the systemic circulation, but are able to cross the blood-brain barrier to exert neuro-active functions both in homeostatic and pathological conditions. Therefore, seaweed-derived constituents have gained increasing interest for their neuro-immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties, rendering them interesting candidates for the management of several neurodegenerative disorders. In particular seaweed-derived phytosterols gained interest for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders as they potentiate neuroplasticity, enhance phagocytic clearance of neurotoxic peptides and have anti-inflammatory properties. Though, the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of other constituents including carotenoids, phenols and polysaccharides have recently gained more interest. In this review, we provide an overview of a selection of the described neuro-active properties of seaweed-derived constituents with a focus on phytosterols.

Malformations of the central nervous system Rare causes of an organic growth hormone deficiency in children	PADIATRIE UND PADOLOGIE			German	Article; Early Access						Rare disease; Hypoplastic anterior pituitary; Empty sella; Septo-optic dysplasia; Organic growth hormone deficiency	MAXILLARY CENTRAL INCISOR; GH DEFICIENCY; PITUITARY-GLAND; EMPTY SELLA; DIAGNOSIS; ABNORMALITIES; ETIOLOGY; MUTATION; MRI	Background Growth hormone (GH) deficiency is a rare endocrine disease. Diagnosis using laboratory investigations must be followed by contrast agent-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system (CNS). Objective Overview of rare CNS malformations associated with GH deficiency in children and adolescents. Material and methods This article was prepared based on lectures held within the framework of a workshop of pediatric endocrinologists in Frankfurt/Main in March 2017. During script preparation, the authors came to a consensus regarding the key statements in the present publication. Results Malformations of the CNS are extremely rare. Among these malformations, pituitary hypoplasia has been most frequently described, followed by the empty sella syndrome and the pituitary stalk interruption syndrome. Ectopic neurohypophysis has been reported in patients with isolated GH deficiency. Septum pellucidum agenesia, corpus callosum defects, ectopic pituitary gland and optic nerve hypoplasia have been found in patients with septo-optic dysplasia. Pharmacological tests of GH secretion revealed markedly lower maximum GH concentrations in patients with CNS anomalies. As a rule, patients with combined CNS anomalies show better response to GH treatment than patients with only a single anomaly. Conclusion The availability of data on CNS malformations in children with GH deficiency is unsatisfactory. The data from patients under GH treatment should continue to be documented and analyzed on a systematic basis.	[Doerr, H.

In this regard, pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy (PDS) in conjunction with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) is an important method in the toolbox of biophysical chemistry. However, the currently available spin labels have diverse deficiencies for in-cell applications, for example, low radical stability or long bioconjugation linkers. In this work, a synthesis strategy is introduced for the derivatization of trityl radicals with a maleimide-functionalized methylene group. The resulting trityl spin label, called SLIM, yields narrow distance distributions, enables highly sensitive distance measurements down to concentrations of 90 nm, and shows high stability against reduction. Using this label, the guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) domain of Yersinia outer protein O (YopO) is shown to change its conformation within eukaryotic cells.

It is an open source free software licensed under the GNU GPL, is platform independent, and does not require any external libraries. Nine years after the original publication of TRAVIS, we highlight some of the recent new functions and features in this article. At the same time, we shortly present some of the underlying algorithms in TRAVIS, which contribute to make trajectory analysis more efficient. Some modern visualization techniques such as Sankey diagrams are also demonstrated. Many analysis functions are implemented, covering structural analyses, dynamical analyses, and functions for predicting vibrational spectra from molecular dynamics simulations. While some of the analyses are known since several decades, others are very recent. For example, TRAVIS has been used to compute the first ab initio predictions in the literature of bulk phase vibrational circular dichroism spectra, bulk phase Raman optical activity spectra, and bulk phase resonance Raman spectra within the last few years.

However, analyzed patient populations and methods strongly differ among these studies. The aim of this study was to prove the reproducibility of published results and to provide a detailed overview of all findings in our NAFLD cohort using next generation sequencing methods. Methods The individual taxonomic microbiota composition of fecal samples from 90 NAFLD patients and 21 healthy controls was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Study participants were grouped according to their disease stage and compared regarding their gut microbiota composition. Studies were identified from PubMed listed publications, and the results were compared with the findings in our cohort. Results Results from 13 identified studies were compared with our data. A decreased abundance of the Bacteroidetes and Ruminococcaceae as well as an increased abundance of Lactobacillaceae and Veillonellaceae and Dorea were the most frequently reported changes among NAFLD patients in 4/13, 5/13, 4/13, 2/13, and 3/13 studies, respectively. Even though these alterations in the gut microbiota composition were also observed in our patient cohort, the majority of published differences could not be reproduced, neither in our own nor in other NAFLD cohort studies. Conclusion Despite repeatedly reproduced abundance patterns of specific bacteria, the heterogeneous study results did not reveal a consistent disease specific gut microbiota signature. Further prospective studies with homogenous patient cohorts and standardized methods are necessary to phenotype NAFLD by the gut microbiota.

Rewiring of glucose metabolism defines trained immunity induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE-JMM			English	Article; Early Access						Trained immunity; Atherosclerosis; Immunometabolism; Inflammation; Cardiovascular disease; Diabetes complications; Glycolysis	CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; ACTIVATION; INFLAMMATION; EPIGENETICS	Stimulation of monocytes with microbial and non-microbial products, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), induces a protracted pro-inflammatory, atherogenic phenotype sustained by metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming via a process called trained immunity. We investigated the intracellular metabolic mechanisms driving oxLDL-induced trained immunity in human primary monocytes and observed concomitant upregulation of glycolytic activity and oxygen consumption. In two separate cohorts of healthy volunteers, we assessed the impact of genetic variation in glycolytic genes on the training capacity of monocytes and found that variants mapped to glycolytic enzymes PFKFB3 and PFKP influenced trained immunity by oxLDL. Subsequent functional validation with inhibitors of glycolytic metabolism revealed dose-dependent inhibition of trained immunity in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo administration of the glucose metabolism modulator metformin abrogated the ability for human monocytes to mount a trained response to oxLDL. These findings underscore the importance of cellular metabolism for oxLDL-induced trained immunity and highlight potential immunomodulatory strategies for clinical management of atherosclerosis. Key messages Brief stimulation of monocytes to oxLDL induces a prolonged inflammatory phenotype. This is due to upregulation of glycolytic metabolism. Genetic variation in glycolytic genes modulates oxLDL-induced trained immunity. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis prevents trained immunity.

At the same time, international scholarly debates emphasise a decline in the policy capacity of societal actors to deal with the complexity of putting policy into practice. South Africa's national development strategy of utilising its unique biodiversity for developing natural products and biopharmaceuticals was anticipated by the government to help overcome the country's triple challenge of unemployment, poverty and inequality. Accompanied by a set of national regulations, introduced to safeguard biodiversity thresholds and regulate socio-economic activities along biomass value chains, this policy of a biodiversity economy is framed by the South African government, as a societal transformation. Informed by a plural theoretical lens drawing upon insights from international scholarly literature on transitions and transformations and insights from policy capacity, implementation research and governance literature, we interrogate qualitative empirical evidence from the field for how and whether such transformation has materialised for different bioprospecting actors in South Africa. Asking which factors enabled or limited this transformation, we distil criteria for what we call transformative policy capacity. We argue that transformations are political and deeply context-dependent relying on the resources and capabilities of involved societal actors to put political plans into practice, including the policy target group. We conclude that a biodiversity economy-driven transformation has yet to become a reality for many South Africans, but efforts are being made to foster the policy capacity of central actors and to adapt the regulatory system to be more conducive for the anticipated change.

Skeleton of a Cretaceous mammal from Madagascar reflects long-term insularity	NATURE			English	Article; Early Access							ADAPTATION; EVOLUTION; REMAINS; ISLAND; RULE; EAR	The fossil record of mammaliaforms (mammals and their closest relatives) of the Mesozoic era from the southern supercontinent Gondwana is far less extensive than that from its northern counterpart, Laurasia(1,2). Among Mesozoic mammaliaforms, Gondwanatheria is one of the most poorly known clades, previously represented by only a single cranium and isolated jaws and teeth(1-5). As a result, the anatomy, palaeobiology and phylogenetic relationships of gondwanatherians remain unclear. Here we report the discovery of an articulated and very well-preserved skeleton of a gondwanatherian of the latest age (72.1-66 million years ago) of the Cretaceous period from Madagascar that we assign to a new genus and species, Adalatherium hui. To our knowledge, the specimen is the most complete skeleton of a Gondwanan Mesozoic mammaliaform that has been found, and includes the only postcranial material and ascending ramus of the dentary known for any gondwanatherian. A phylogenetic analysis including the new taxon recovers Gondwanatheria as the sister group to Multituberculata. The skeleton, which represents one of the largest of the Gondwanan Mesozoic mammaliaforms, is particularly notable for exhibiting many unique features in combination with features that are convergent on those of therian mammals. This uniqueness is consistent with a lineage history for A. hui of isolation on Madagascar for more than 20 million years. Adalatherium hui, a newly discovered gondwanatherian mammal from Madagascar dated to near the end of the Cretaceous period, shows features consistent with a long evolutionary trajectory of isolation in an insular environment.

Deep search for hydrogen peroxide toward pre- and protostellar objects: Testing the pathway of grain surface water formation	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: molecules; ISM: abundances; methods: observational; stars: formation; submillimeter: ISM; astrochemistry	MOLECULAR-OXYGEN; STAR-FORMATION; ICE; SUBMILLIMETER; O-2; PHOTODESORPTION; CONSTRAINTS; POPULATION; CHEMISTRY; ABUNDANCE	Context. In the laboratory, hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) was proven to be an intermediate product in the solid-state reaction scheme that leads to the formation of water on icy dust grains. When HOOH desorbs from the icy grains, it can be detected in the gas phase. In combination with water detections, it may provide additional information on the water reaction network. Hydrogen peroxide has previously been found toward rho Oph A. However, further searches for this molecule in other sources failed. Hydrogen peroxide plays a fundamental role in the understanding of solid-state water formation and the overall water reservoir in young stellar objects (YSOs). Without further HOOH detections, it is difficult to assess and develop suitable chemical models that properly take into account the formation of water on icy surfaces.Aims. The objective of this work is to identify HOOH in YSOs and thereby constrain the grain surface water formation hypothesis.Methods. Using an astrochemical model based on previous work in combination with a physical model of YSOs, the sources R CrA-IRS 5A, NGC C1333-IRAS 2A, L1551-IRS 5, and L1544 were identified as suitable candidates for an HOOH detection. Long integration times on the APEX 12 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes were applied to search for HOOH signatures in these sources.Results. None of the four sources under investigation showed convincing spectral signatures of HOOH. The upper limit for HOOH abundance based on the noise level at the frequency positions of this molecule for the source R CrA-IRS 5A was close to the predicted value. For NGC 1333-IRAS 2A, L1544, and L1551-IRS 5, the model overestimated the hydrogen peroxide abundances.Conclusions. HOOH remains an elusive molecule. With only one secure cosmic HOOH source detected so far, namely rho Oph A, the chemical model parameters for this molecule cannot be sufficiently well determined or confirmed in existing models. Possible reasons for the nondetections of HOOH are discussed.	[Fuchs, G. W.; Witsch, D.; Herberth, D.; Kempkes, M.; Stanclik, B.; Giesen, T.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can correct the hematological phenotype and is indicated in transfusion-dependent patients. In 70 children reported to the German DBA and French HSCT registries, HSCT was performed from 1985 to 2017. Median age at HSCT was 5.5 years (range, 0.9-17.3 years). Two-thirds of patients (64%) were transplanted from a matched sibling donor (MSD), and most procedures were performed after the year 1999 (73%). Primary engraftment was achieved in all patients. One patient developed secondary graft failure. Cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 24% for degrees II-IV (95% confidence interval [CI], 16% to 37%) and 7% for degrees III-IV (95% CI, 3% to 17%); cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 11% (95% CI, 5% to 22%). The probability of chronic GVHD-free survival (cGFS) was 87% (95% CI, 79% to 95%) and significantly improved over time (<2000: 68% [95% CI, 47% to 89%] vs >= 2000: 94% [95% CI, 87% to 100%], P < .01). cGFS was comparable following HSCT from a MSD and an unrelated donor (UD). Of note, no severe chronic GVHD or deaths were reported following MSD-HSCT after 1999. The difference of cGFS in children transplanted <10 years of age compared with older patients did not reach statistical significance (<10 years: 90% [95% CI, 81% to 99%] vs 10-18 years 78% [95% CI, 58% to 98%]). In summary, these data indicate that HSCT is efficient and safe in young DBA patients and should be considered if a MSD or matched UD is available. HSCT for transfusion dependency only must be critically discussed in older patients.

This vision focuses on five perspectives: individual and public engagement, involvement of health professionals, implementation within healthcare systems, health-related data, and the development of sustainable economic models that allow improved therapy, diagnostic and preventive approaches as new healthcare concepts for the benefit of the public. We further identify four pillars representing transversal issues that are crucial for the successful implementation of PM in all perspectives. The implementation of PM will result in more efficient and equitable healthcare, access to modern healthcare methods, and improved control by individuals of their own health data, as well as economic development in the health sector.

Inhibition of Tumor VEGFR2 Induces Serine 897 EphA2-Dependent Tumor Cell Invasion and Metastasis in NSCLC	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE; MAMMALIAN TARGET; GENE-EXPRESSION; EPH RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; ANGIOGENESIS; THERAPY; CANCER; PROGRESSION	Anti-angiogenic treatment targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-VEGFR2 signaling has shown limited efficacy in lung cancer patients. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of VEGFR2 in tumor cells, expressed in similar to 20% of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, leads to a pro-invasive phenotype. Drug-induced inhibition of tumor VEGFR2 interferes with the formation of the EphA2/VEGFR2 heterocomplex, thereby allowing RSK to interact with Serine 897 of EphA2. Inhibition of RSK decreases phosphorylation of Serine 897 EphA2. Selective genetic modeling of Serine 897 of EphA2 or inhibition of EphA2 abrogates the formation of metastases in vivo upon VEGFR2 inhibition. In summary, these findings demonstrate that VEGFR2-targeted therapy conditions VEGFR2-positive NSCLC to Serine 897 EphA2-dependent aggressive tumor growth and metastasis. These data shed light on the molecular mechanisms explaining the limited efficacy of VEGFR2-targeted anti-angiogenic treatment in lung cancer patients.

Since the density of states typically exhibits only square root or cubic root cusp singularities, our work complements previous results on the bulk and edge universality and it thus completes the resolution of the Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universality conjecture for the last remaining universality type in the complex Hermitian class. Our analysis holds not only for exact cusps, but approximate cusps as well, where an extended Pearcey process emerges. As a main technical ingredient we prove an optimal local law at the cusp for both symmetry classes. This result is also the key input in the companion paper (Cipolloni et al. in Pure Appl Anal, 2018. arXiv:1811.04055) where the cusp universality for real symmetric Wigner-type matrices is proven. The novel cusp fluctuation mechanism is also essential for the recent results on the spectral radius of non-Hermitian random matrices (Alt et al. in Spectral radius of random matrices with independent entries, 2019. arXiv:1907.13631), and the non-Hermitian edge universality (Cipolloni et al. in Edge universality for non-Hermitian random matrices, 2019. arXiv:1908.00969).

A latent class approach to inequity in health using biomarker data	HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article; Early Access						biomarkers; decomposition analysis; equality of opportunity; finite mixture models; health equity; latent class models	CARE UTILIZATION; OPPORTUNITY; INEQUALITY; EQUALITY; CIRCUMSTANCES; MORTALITY; SMOKING	We adopt an empirical approach to analyse, measure and decompose inequality of opportunity (IOp) in health, based on a latent class model. This addresses some of the limitations that affect earlier work in this literature concerning the definition of types, such as partial observability, the ad hoc selection of circumstances, the curse of dimensionality and unobserved type-specific heterogeneity that may lead to biased estimates of IOp. We apply our latent class approach to measure IOp in allostatic load, a composite measure of biomarker data. Using data from Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), we find that a latent class model with three latent types best fits the data, with the corresponding types characterised in terms of differences in their observed circumstances. Decomposition analysis shows that about two thirds of the total inequalities in allostatic load can be attributed to the direct and indirect contribution of circumstances and that the direct contribution of effort is small. Further analysis conditional on age-sex groups reveals that the relative (percentage) contribution of circumstances to the total inequalities remains mostly unaffected and the direct contribution of effort remains small.

ALICE Collaboration	Production of (anti-)He-3 and (anti-)H-3 in p-Pb collisions at root s(NN)=5.02 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW C			English	Article							LIGHT-NUCLEI PRODUCTION; MULTIPLICITY DEPENDENCE; CROSS-SECTIONS; COALESCENCE; ABSORPTION	The transverse momentum (p(T)) differential yields of (anti-)He-3 and (anti-)H-3 measured in p-Pb collisions at root s(NN) = 5.02 TeV with ALICE at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented. The ratios of the p(T)-integrated yields of (anti-)He-3 and (anti-)H-3 to the proton yields are reported, as well as the pT dependence of the coalescence parameters B-3 for (anti-)He-3 and (anti-)H-3. For (anti-)He-3, the results obtained in four classes of the mean charged-particle multiplicity density are also discussed. These results are compared to predictions from a canonical statistical hadronization model and coalescence approaches. An upper limit on the total yield of (4)(He) over bar is determined.

J	Wang, ZS; Wang, KC				Wang, Zeren Simon; Wang, Kechen			Physics with far detectors at future lepton colliders	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							NEUTRINO MASS; HEAVY NEUTRINOS; SEARCH; SYMMETRY; SPHENO; DECAYS; LIGHT	At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), several far detectors such as FASER and MATHUSLA have been proposed to target the long-lived particles (LLPs) featured with displaced vertices. Naturally one question arises as to the feasibility of installing similar far detectors at future lepton colliders like the CEPC and FCC-ee. Because of the different kinematics of final state particles and the freedom to locate both the experiment hall and the detectors, the future lepton collider with an additional far detector may play a unique role in searching for LLPs. In this study, we consider various locations and designs of far detectors at future e- ethorn colliders and investigate their potentials for discovering LLPs in the physics scenarios including exotic Higgs decays, heavy neutral leptons, and the lightest neutralinos. Our analyses show that the kinematical distinctions between the lepton and hadron colliders render the optimal positions of far detectors lying at the direction perpendicular to the collider beams at future e- ethorn colliders, in contrast to the LHC where a boost in the forward direction can be exploited. We also find that when searching for LLPs, such new experiments with far detectors at future lepton colliders may extend and complement the sensitivity reaches of the experiments at the future lepton colliders with usual near detectors, and the present and future experiments at the LHC. In particular, we find that, for the theory models considered in this study, a MATHUSLA-sized far detector would give a modest improvement compared to the case with a near detector only at future lepton colliders.

Objective Which pelvic injuries are stabilized with symphyseal plating and what is their outcome? Material and methods A retrospective evaluation of 64 patients who underwent symphyseal plating over a period of 24 months was conducted. Results Of the patients 56 were male and 8 female with a mean age of 44 years (SD & x202f;+/- 17 years). The main cause of the pelvic injuries were traffic accidents. The distribution according to the AO fracture classification was 14 & x202f;x B1, 10 & x202f;x B2, 5 & x202f;x B3, 23 & x202f;x C1, 9 & x202f;x C2 and 3 & x202f;x C3 injuries. The distribution according to the Young and Burgess classification showed 9 & x202f;x APC I, 18 & x202f;x APC II, 13 & x202f;x APC III, 9 & x202f;x LC I, 3 & x202f;x LC II, 2 & x202f;x LC III and 10 & x202f;x VS injuries. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 32 (SD & x202f;+/- 17) and the mean inpatient stay was 29 days (SD & x202f;+/- 16 days; positive correlation p & x202f;<= 0.001). Radiological implant loosening occurred in 52 patients. 14 patients required treatment for severe complications. The leading reason for revision surgery was implant failure (n & x202f;= 8). Conclusion These observations suggest that radiological signs of implant loosening are commonly observed but rarely the reason for revision surgery. Complete implant failures, however; occur mainly within the first postoperative weeks and require early revision. A timely clarification by additional X-ray imaging should be carried out if this is suspected.

J	Moritz, L; Koch, M				Moritz, Leif; Koch, Markus			No Tomosvary organ in flat backed millipedes (Diplopoda, Polydesmida)	ZOOKEYS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th International Congress of Myriapodology	AUG 25-31, 2019	Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Budapest, HUNGARY		Hungarian Nat Hist Museum	Anatomy; Histology; Micro-Computed Tomography; Morphology; Tentorium	PHYLOGENY	The Tomosvary organ is a sensory structure of the head in myriapods and some other terrestrial arthropods. Due to its variable shape, size, and position in millipedes (Diplopoda) the Tomosvary organ is commonly used as diagnostic character in taxonomic descriptions and often included in phylogenetic analyses. For the Polydesmida, the largest millipede order, the Tomosvary organ is inconsistently stated as being either absent or present as a pear-shaped pit covered by a membrane or cuticular disc. In order to resolve this inconsistency, we investigated the morphology of the presumable Tomosvary organ in four polydesmidan species based on paraffin-histology, semi-thin sections and micro-computed tomography. Our results unambiguously favor the view that the articulation of the cephalic tentorium with the head capsule was misidentified as the Tomosvary organ in previous studies, and thus that the Tomosvary organ indeed is absent in the Polydesmida. The pear-shaped pit proved to represent the distal roundish expansion of the incisura lateralis, to which - similarly as in julidan millipedes - the tentorial transverse bar is articulated. The absence of the Tomosvary organ in the Polydesmida does not affect the topology of the interrelationships among the millipede orders retrieved in previous cladistic analyses based on morphology. As a character shared by Colobognatha and Juliformia, however, absence of a Tomosvary organ in Polydesmida favors the optimization of its presence in nematophoran millipedes as a reversal. Further studies are needed to clarify whether among chilognathan millipedes a Tomosvary organ really exists in taxa such as Stemmiulida, and whether the Tomosvary organs are homologous across millipedes.

Chemical signatures of soft tissues distinguish between vertebrates and invertebrates from the Carboniferous Mazon Creek Lagerstatte of Illinois	GEOBIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						chitin; chordate; in situ Raman spectroscopy; keratin; protein fossilization products; Tully Monster	TULLY MONSTER; FOSSILIZATION	The chemical composition of fossil soft tissues is a potentially powerful and yet underutilized tool for elucidating the affinity of problematic fossil organisms. In some cases, it has proven difficult to assign a problematic fossil even to the invertebrates or vertebrates (more generally chordates) based on often incompletely preserved morphology alone, and chemical composition may help to resolve such questions. Here, we use in situ Raman microspectroscopy to investigate the chemistry of a diverse array of invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from the Pennsylvanian Mazon Creek Lagerstatte of Illinois, and we generate a ChemoSpace through principal component analysis (PCA) of the in situ Raman spectra. Invertebrate soft tissues characterized by chitin (polysaccharide) fossilization products and vertebrate soft tissues characterized by protein fossilization products plot in completely separate, non-overlapping regions of the ChemoSpace, demonstrating the utility of certain soft tissue molecular signatures as biomarkers for the original soft tissue composition of fossil organisms. The controversial problematicum Tullimonstrum, known as the Tully Monster, groups with the vertebrates, providing strong evidence of a vertebrate rather than invertebrate affinity.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) have rarely been reported. The aim of this study is to objectively assess LUTS in patients with LOPD for the first time using urodynamic studies and to determine differences between LOPD patients with and without LUTS. Methods Eighteen patients with LOPD were recruited, of whom seven patients (38.9%) reported LUTS (both voiding and storage symptoms). Six of these patients underwent urodynamic studies. Medical histories and motor function tests were compared between the 7 patients with LUTS and the 11 patients without LUTS. The Student t test was used to determine an association between the two cohorts. Results In the seven LOPD patients with LUTS urodynamics revealed neurogenic dysfunction, underactive detrusor, and bladder outlet obstruction. These patients had suffered from clinical symptoms for a longer period of time before starting enzyme replacement therapy (P = .017) than patients without LUTS. They also scored more poorly on muscle function tests. Urodynamic results point to neurogenic causes for LUTS in LOPD, that is, neurogenic reflex bladder or impaired filling sensation. This could be due to glycogen accumulation in the urothelium and central nervous system. Patients with LUTS also seem to be more severely affected by LOPD than patients without LUTS. Conclusion LUTS in LOPD requires early and specific treatment to limit the development of severe health problems. Urodynamic studies should be considered in assessing LUTS.

Euclid: The reduced shear approximation and magnification bias for Stage IV cosmic shear experiments	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; cosmology: observations; methods: analytical	DARK ENERGY; WEAK; CONSTRAINTS; STATISTICS; MATTER	Context. Stage IV weak lensing experiments will offer more than an order of magnitude leap in precision. We must therefore ensure that our analyses remain accurate in this new era. Accordingly, previously ignored systematic effects must be addressed.Aims. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the reduced shear approximation and magnification bias on information obtained from the angular power spectrum. To first-order, the statistics of reduced shear, a combination of shear and convergence, are taken to be equal to those of shear. However, this approximation can induce a bias in the cosmological parameters that can no longer be neglected. A separate bias arises from the statistics of shear being altered by the preferential selection of galaxies and the dilution of their surface densities in high-magnification regions.Methods. The corrections for these systematic effects take similar forms, allowing them to be treated together. We calculated the impact of neglecting these effects on the cosmological parameters that would be determined from Euclid, using cosmic shear tomography. To do so, we employed the Fisher matrix formalism, and included the impact of the super-sample covariance. We also demonstrate how the reduced shear correction can be calculated using a lognormal field forward modelling approach.Results. These effects cause significant biases in Omega (m), sigma (8), n(s), Omega (DE), w(0), and w(a) of -0.53 sigma, 0.43 sigma, -0.34 sigma, 1.36 sigma, -0.68 sigma, and 1.21 sigma, respectively. We then show that these lensing biases interact with another systematic effect: the intrinsic alignment of galaxies. Accordingly, we have developed the formalism for an intrinsic alignment-enhanced lensing bias correction. Applying this to Euclid, we find that the additional terms introduced by this correction are sub-dominant.	[Deshpande, A. C.; Kitching, T. D.; Taylor, P.

Determining Electric Fields in Thunderclouds With the Radiotelescope LOFAR	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							THUNDERSTORM; ELECTRIFICATION; CHARGE; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATION	An analysis is presented of electric fields in thunderclouds using a recently proposed method based on measuring radio emission from extensive air shower events during thunderstorm conditions. This method can be regarded as a tomography of thunderclouds using cosmic rays as probes. The data cover the period from December 2011 till August 2014. We have developed an improved fitting procedure to be able to analyze the data. Our measurements show evidence for the main negative-charge layer near the -10 degrees isotherm. This we have seen for a winter as well as for a summer cloud where multiple events pass through the same cloud and also the vertical component of the electric field could be reconstructed. On the day of measurement of some cosmic-ray events showing evidence for strong fields, no lightning activity was detected within 100 km distance. For the winter events, the top heights were between 5 and 6 km, while in the summer, typical top heights of 9 km were seen. Large horizontal components in excess of 70 kV/m of the electric fields are observed in the middle and top layers.	[Trinh, T. N.

Investigation of Visual System Involvement in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 14	CEREBELLUM			English	Article; Early Access						Spinocerebellar ataxias; Protein kinase C gamma; Optical coherence tomography; Vision disorders	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CONTRAST LETTER ACUITY; NERVE-FIBER LAYER; PKC-GAMMA; NEUROOPHTHALMIC SUPPLEMENT; DISEASE PROGRESSION; VISION; DYSFUNCTION	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA-PRKCG, formerly SCA14) is a rare, slowly progressive disorder caused by conventional mutations in protein kinase C gamma (PKC gamma). The disease usually manifests with ataxia, but previous reports suggested PRKCG variants in retinal pathology. To systematically investigate for the first time visual function and retinal morphology in patients with SCA-PRKCG. Seventeen patients with PRKCG variants and 17 healthy controls were prospectively recruited, of which 12 genetically confirmed SCA-PRKCG patients and 14 matched controls were analyzed. We enquired a structured history for visual symptoms. Vision-related quality of life was obtained with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) including the Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement (NOS). Participants underwent testing of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, and retinal morphology with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Measurements of the SCA-PRKCG group were analyzed for their association with clinical parameters (ataxia rating and disease duration). SCA-PRKCG patients rate their vision-related quality of life in NEI-VFQ significantly worse than controls. Furthermore, binocular visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were worse in SCA-PRKCG patients compared with controls. Despite this, none of the OCT measurements differed between groups. NEI-VFQ and NOS composite scores were related to ataxia severity. Additionally, we describe one patient with a genetic variant of uncertain significance in the catalytic domain of PKC gamma who, unlike all confirmed SCA-PRKCG, presented with a clinically silent epitheliopathy. SCA-PRKCG patients had reduced binocular vision and vision-related quality of life. Since no structural retinal damage was found, the pathomechanism of these findings remains unclear.

Cross-codal integration of bridging-event information in narrative understanding	MEMORY & COGNITION			English	Article; Early Access						Bridging inferences; Narrative understanding; Cross-codal integration	SITUATION MODELS; READING TIMES; COMPREHENSION; MEMORY; CONSTRUCTION; TEXT; INFERENCES; PERCEPTION	Visual narratives communicate event sequences by using different code systems such as pictures and texts. Thus, comprehenders must integrate information from different codalities. This study addressed such cross-codal integration processes by investigating how the codality of bridging-event information (i.e., pictures, text) affects the understanding of visual narrative events. In Experiment 1, bridging-event information was either present (as picture or text) or absent (i.e., not shown). The viewing times for the subsequent picture depicting the end state of the action were comparable within the absent and the text conditions. Further, the viewing times for the end-state picture were significantly longer in the text condition as compared to the pictorial condition. In Experiment 2, we tested whether replacing bridging-event information with a blank panel increases viewing times in a way similar to the text condition. Bridging event information was either present (as picture) or absent (not shown vs. blank panel). The results replicated Experiment 1. Additionally, the viewing times for the end-state pictures were longest in the blank condition. In Experiment 3, we investigated the costs related to integrating information from different codalities by directly comparing the text and picture conditions with the blank condition. The results showed that the distortion caused by the blank panel is larger than the distortion caused by cross-codal integration processes. Summarizing, we conclude that cross-codal information processing during narrative comprehension is possible but associated with additional mental effort. We discuss the results with regard to theories of narrative understanding.

In general, the main focus is on population parameters related to the expected treatment effects or group differences among all units of an upper level (e.g. subjects in many settings). Optimal design for estimation of population parameters are well established for many models. However, optimal designs for the prediction for the individual units may be different. Several settings are identified in which individual prediction may be of interest. In this paper, we determine optimal designs for the individual predictions, e.g. in multi-cluster trials or in trials that investigate a new treatment in a number of different subpopulations, and compare them to a conventional balanced design with respect to treatment allocation. Our investigations show that in the case of uncorrelated cluster intercepts and cluster treatments the optimal allocations are far from being balanced if the treatment effects vary strongly as compared to the residual error and more subjects should be recruited to the active (new) treatment. Nevertheless, efficiency loss may be limited resulting in a moderate sample size increase when individual predictions are foreseen with a balanced allocation.

LPA promotes hair growth and differentiation. In this study we aimed at delineating the genetic basis of LAH in patients without pathogenic variants in these three genes. Methods Variant analysis was conducted using exome and direct sequencing. We then performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunofluorescence staining, immunoblotting, enzymatic, and coimmunoprecipitation assays to evaluate the consequences of potential etiologic variants. Results We identified homozygous variants in C3ORF52 in four individuals with LAH. C3ORF52 was found to be coexpressed with lipase H in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle and the two proteins were found to directly interact. The LAH-causing variants were associated with decreased C3ORF52 expression and resulted in markedly reduced lipase H-mediated LPA biosynthesis. Conclusion LAH can be caused by abnormal function of at least three proteins which are necessary for proper LPA biosynthesis.

Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others. Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China. To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country. In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario. The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax. Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable "real-time" monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures. In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound. Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach.

In particular, in contrast to its local analogue, this nonlocal problem does not enjoy a gauge invariance. The uniqueness result is complemented by an associated logarithmic stability estimate under suitable apriori assumptions. Also uniqueness under finitely many generic measurements is discussed. Here the genericity is obtained through singularity theory which might also be interesting in the context of hybrid inverse problems. Combined with the results from Ghosh et al. (Uniqueness and reconstruction for the fractional Calderon problem with a single easurement, 2018. ), this yields a finite measurements constructive reconstruction algorithm for the fractional Calderon problem with drift. The inverse problem is formulated as a partial data type nonlocal problem and it is considered in any dimension n >= 1.

The modulation of glia cell function represents an attractive therapeutic strategy, but is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of its relevance for AD. The chemotactic G-protein coupled formyl peptide receptor (FPR), which is known to modulate A beta 1-42 uptake and signal transduction, might be one candidate molecule regulating glia function in AD. Here, we investigate whether the modulation of FPR exerts beneficial effects in an AD preclinical model. Methods To address this question, APP/PS1 double-transgenic AD mice were treated for 20 weeks with either the pro-inflammatory FPR agonist fMLF, the FPR1/2 antagonist Boc2 or the anti-inflammatory FPR2 agonist Ac2-26. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated using a Morris water maze test. Immunohistological staining, gene expression studies, and flow cytometry analyses were performed to study neuronal loss, gliosis, and Ass-load in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively. Results FPR antagonism by Boc2-treatment significantly improved spatial memory performance, reduced neuronal pathology, induced the expression of homeostatic growth factors, and ameliorated microglia, but not astrocyte, reactivity. Furthermore, the elevated levels of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus were reduced by Boc2-treatment, presumably by an induction of amyloid degradation. Conclusions We suggest that the modulation of FPR signaling cascades might be considered as a promising therapeutic approach for alleviating the cognitive deficits associated with early AD. Additional studies are now needed to address the downstream effectors as well as the safety profile of Boc2.

LY393558 reduces 5-HT-induced vasoconstriction and remodelling of rat and/or mouse pulmonary arteries. The aim of our study was to examine the effect of LY393558 on the 5-HT-stimulated vasoconstriction of human pulmonary arteries (hPAs) and to determine the underlying mechanism(s). Methods Vascular effects of 5-HT receptor agonists, antagonists and a SERT inhibitor were examined in organ bath studies on intralobar hPAs obtained from patients during resection of lung carcinoma. Results Serotonin and agonists of the 5-HT1B receptor (5-carboxamidotryptamine, 5-CT) and 5-HT2A receptor (alpha-methyl-5-HT) contracted endothelium-intact hPAs in a concentration-dependent fashion. The 5-HT1B antagonists SB224289 and GR55562 reduced responses induced by 5-HT and 5-CT and the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin inhibited the effects of 5-HT and alpha-methyl-5-HT. Administration of the SERT inhibitor citalopram (at a concentration that failed to modify the 5-HT-induced vasoconstriction) in combination with SB224289 or GR55562 was more effective in inhibiting the response to 5-HT than the 5-HT1B antagonists alone. LY393558 showed the greatest antagonistic effect against the vasoconstriction elicited by 5-HT, 5-CT and alpha-methyl-5-HT. Conclusions LY393558 reduces the 5-HT-induced contraction antagonizing 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors probably due to synergic interaction between SERT inhibition and 5-HT1B receptor antagonism. Thus, it might represent a valuable future option in the pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy.

The 3-year-old girl disappeared from the house next door and was found dead floating in a stream 1 month later. Advanced putrefaction made it difficult to ascertain the cause of death, a fracture system on the skull did not lead to the identification of a weapon after preservation of the skull as evidential material but to a heavy burden on the parents and a never completed mourning. Only the termination of the investigation after 35 years allowed a retrospective consideration of the limits of the medicolegal expertise at that time as well as the investigation of a crime carried out with high criminal energy, which was never elucidated for want of a confession.

Here we demonstrate a feasible technique for proton and ion beam spectroscopy (PIBS) capable of determining the elemental compositions of the irradiated tissues during particle therapy. This follows the developments in prompt gamma imaging for online range verification and the inheritance from prompt gamma neutron activation analysis. Samples of water solutions were prepared to emulate varying oxygen and carbon concentrations. The irradiation of those samples and other tissue surrogate inserts by protons and ion beams under clinical conditions clearly showed a logarithmic relationship between the target elemental composition and the prompt gamma production. This finding is in line with the known logarithmic dependence of the pH with the proton molar concentration. Elemental concentration changes of 1% for calcium and 2% for oxygen in adipose, brain, breast, liver, muscle and bone-related tissue surrogates were clearly identified. Real-time in vivo measurements of oxygen, carbon and calcium concentrations will be evaluated in a pre-clinical and clinical environment. This technique should have an important impact in the assessment of tumour hypoxia over the course of several treatment fractions and the tracking of calcifications in brain metastases.

The new species is characterised by a mixed type of radial tracheary pitting, araucarioid cross-field pitting, high uniseriate rays, and the occurrence of traumatic resin canals. The new finding represents the second species of Brachyoxylon from the Guantou Formation and it contributes to the further understanding of the forest composition of the Early Cretaceous flora in eastern China.The quantitative analysis of growth ring anatomy indicates that the forest composition was evergreen with a Leaf Retention Time (LRT) of 3-15 years. It is deduced that the Zhejiang Province was dominated by a subtropical to tropical and relatively semiarid climate during the Early Cretaceous.

We have studied the impact of severe hypoxia (0.5 mg O-2/L) on the ionic transport across posterior gills of Carcinus maenas acclimated to 12 ppt seawater (DSW). The short-circuit current (Isc) across hemilamellae from gills i.e. active ion transport was studied in micro Ussing chambers. Hypoxia induced by deoxygenation of the basolateral side, and not the apical side, resulted in time-dependent inhibition of Isc and full recovery of Isc after reoxygenation. Exposure of the crabs to severe 7 h hypoxia decreased the specific activity of Na+,K+-ATPase in the gills by 36%. Full recovery of enzyme activity occurred in fasted crabs after 3 days of reoxygenation. The intensity of Western blotting bands was not different in the gills of oxygenated, hypoxic and reoxygenated crabs. The reversible, nonspecific blocker of K+ channels Cs and hypoxia inhibited over 90% of Isc which is after reoxygenation fully recovered. The specific blocker of Cl- channels NPPB [5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid] blocked Isc by 68.5%. Only the rest of not inhibited Isc in aerated saline was blocked by hypoxia and recovered after reoxygenation. The activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase was not changed during hypoxia and reoxygenation kept the high enzyme activity in the gills at the level of crabs acclimated to DSW. As a response to hypoxia the presence of 2 mM H2O2 induce an initial slight transient decrease of Isc followed by a rise and after reoxygenation fully recovered Isc. Incubation of hemilamellae with the antioxidant derivative Trolox did not affect the inhibition of Isc by hypoxia.

This is done by considering a moduli space of Breuil-Kisin modules, satisfying an additional Galois condition, over the unrestricted deformation ring. For K unramified over Q(p) and Hodge-Tate weights in [0, p], we study the geometry of this space. As a consequence, we prove that, under a mild cyclotomic-freeness assumption, all crystalline representations of an unramified extension of Q(p), with Hodge-Tate weights in [0, p], are potentially diagonalizable.

HepHIV Conf Organizing Comm; EuroTEST Steering Comm; INTEGRATE Steering Comm	A call to action toward integrated testing and earlier care for viral hepatitis, HIV, STIs and TB	HIV MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						diagnosis; HIV; sexually transmitted infections; testing; viral hepatitis		Objectives The objective of the paper is to present the outcomes of the HepHIV 2019 conference, held in Bucharest under the Romanian EU Presidency and focusing on challenges of timely and integrated testing and care. Methods The conference programme was put together by the organizing committee. It consisted of invited talks and peer-reviewed abstracts. Results In all, 65 abstracts from 20 countries were presented during the conference, which had nearly 250 delegates, including high-profile political representation. The conference highlighted the need to shift towards further disease integration because of the epidemiological characteristics of the hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), HIV, sexually transmitted infection (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics in the WHO European region. Integration should be a priority in the response to the epidemics to better reach key populations and to ensure better testing coverage. This relates to both the integration of services in shared care models and the integration of different settings and stakeholders in national strategies. Conclusions The conference demonstrated the need for greater political support for the policy changes required to implement integration. Testing normalization efforts are key to maximizing the impact of integration efforts. The conference call to action can help to guide developments in testing and linkage-to-care interventions across the European region.

The phenotype of adverse drug effects: Do emergency visits due to adverse drug reactions look different in older people? Results from the ADRED study	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						adverse drug reaction; emergency departments; network analysis; older adults; symptoms	REACTION-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS; ASSOCIATION RULE; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; RISK; EVENTS; POLYPHARMACY; POPULATION; DEPARTMENTS; ADMISSIONS; FRAILTY	Aims Older patients in particular suffer from adverse drug reactions (ADR) when presenting in the emergency department. We aimed to characterise the phenotype of those ADRs, to be able to recognise an ADR in older patients. Methods Cases of ADRs in emergency departments collected within the multicentre prospective observational study (ADRED) were analysed (n = 2215). We analysed ADR-associated diagnoses, symptoms and their risk profiles. We present frequencies and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals for adults (18-64 years) compared to older adults (>= 65 years; young-old 65-79, old-old >= 80 years) and regression coefficients (B) for each year of age. Results Most prominent differences were seen for drug-associated confusion, dehydration, and bradycardia (OR 6.70 [1.59-28.27], B .054; OR 6.02 [2.41-15.03], B .081, and 4.82 [2.21-10.54], B .040), more likely seen in older adults. Bleedings were reported in all age groups, but gastrointestinal bleedings occurred with more than doubled chance in older adults (OR 2.46 [1.77-3.41], B .030), likewise did other bleedings such as haemorrhage from respiratory passages (OR 2.89 [1.37-6.11], B.036). Falls were more likely in older adults (OR 2.84 [1.77-4.53], B .030), while dizziness was frequent in both age groups. Conclusion Our data point to differences in symptoms of ADRs between adults and older individuals, with dangerous drug-associated phenomena in the older adult such as bleedings or falls. Physicians should consider drug-associated origins of symptoms in older adults with an increased risk for serious health problems.

Accordingly, approaches are sought after that aid in assessing the odds of success with an optimization project and making decisions whether to continue or discontinue work on an analog series at a given stage. However, currently there are only very few approaches available that are capable of providing decision support. We introduce a computational methodology designed to combine the assessment of chemical saturation of analog series and structure-activity relationship (SAR) progression. The current endpoint of these development efforts, the compound optimization monitor (COMO), further extends lead optimization diagnostics to compound design and activity prediction. Hence, COMO plays dual role in supporting lead optimization campaigns.

Oper. Res. 1983] says that an integer linear program can be solved in fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) time for the parameterization by the number of variables. We extend this result by incorporating piecewise linear convex or concave functions to our (mixed) integer programs. This general technique allows us to analyze the parameterized complexity of a number of classic NP-hard computational problems. In particular, we prove that WEIGHTED SET MULTICOVER is in FPT when parameterized by the number of elements to cover, and that there exists an FPT-time approximation scheme for MULTISET MULTICOVER for the same parameter-this is our most technical result. Further, we use our general technique to prove that a number of problems from computational social choice (e.g., problems related to bribery and control in elections) are in FPT when parameterized by the number of candidates. For bribery, this resolves a nearly 10-year old family of open problems, and for weighted electoral control of Approval voting, this improves some previously known XP-memberships to FPT-memberships.

SK channel-mediated metabolic escape to glycolysis inhibits ferroptosis and supports stress resistance in C. elegans	CELL DEATH & DISEASE			English	Article							LIFE-SPAN EXTENSION; MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATION; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; ENERGY-METABOLISM; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CELL-DEATH; LACTATE PRODUCTION; MEV-1 MUTANT; K+ CHANNELS; CANCER	Metabolic flexibility is an essential characteristic of eukaryotic cells in order to adapt to physiological and environmental changes. Especially in mammalian cells, the metabolic switch from mitochondrial respiration to aerobic glycolysis provides flexibility to sustain cellular energy in pathophysiological conditions. For example, attenuation of mitochondrial respiration and/or metabolic shifts to glycolysis result in a metabolic rewiring that provide beneficial effects in neurodegenerative processes. Ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death triggered by an impaired redox balance is gaining attention in the field of neurodegeneration. We showed recently that activation of small-conductance calcium-activated K+ (SK) channels modulated mitochondrial respiration and protected neuronal cells from oxidative death. Here, we investigated whether SK channel activation with CyPPA induces a glycolytic shift thereby increasing resilience of neuronal cells against ferroptosis, induced by erastin in vitro and in the nematode C. elegans exposed to mitochondrial poisons in vivo. High-resolution respirometry and extracellular flux analysis revealed that CyPPA, a positive modulator of SK channels, slightly reduced mitochondrial complex I activity, while increasing glycolysis and lactate production. Concomitantly, CyPPA rescued the neuronal cells from ferroptosis, while scavenging mitochondrial ROS and inhibiting glycolysis reduced its protection. Furthermore, SK channel activation increased survival of C. elegans challenged with mitochondrial toxins. Our findings shed light on metabolic mechanisms promoted through SK channel activation through mitohormesis, which enhances neuronal resilience against ferroptosis in vitro and promotes longevity in vivo.

J	Steinheuer, J; Friederichs, P				Steinheuer, Julian; Friederichs, Petra			Vertical profiles of wind gust statistics from a regional reanalysis using multivariate extreme value theory	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION; MODEL; DECOMPOSITION	Many applications require wind gust estimates at very different atmospheric height levels. For example, the renewable energy sector is interested in wind and gust predictions at the hub height of a wind power plant. However, numerical weather prediction models typically only derive estimates for wind gusts at the standard measurement height of 10 m above the land surface. Here, we present a statistical post-processing method to derive a conditional distribution for hourly peak wind speed as a function of height. The conditioning variables are taken from the COSMO-REA6 regional reanalysis. The post-processing method was trained using peak wind speed observations at five vertical levels between 10 and 250 m from the Hamburg Weather Mast. The statistical post-processing method is based on a censored generalized extreme value (cGEV) distribution with nonhomogeneous parameters. We use a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator to select the most informative variables. Vertical variations of the cGEV parameters are approximated using Legendre polynomials, such that predictions may be derived at any desired vertical height. Further, the Pickands dependence function is used to assess dependencies between gusts at different heights. The most important predictors are the 10 m gust diagnostic, the barotropic and the baroclinic mode of absolute horizontal wind speed, the mean absolute horizontal wind at 700 hPa, the surface pressure tendency, and the lifted index. Proper scores show improvements of up to 60 % with respect to climatology, especially at higher vertical levels. The post-processing model with a Legendre approximation is able to provide reliable predictions of gusts' statistics at non-observed intermediate levels. The strength of dependency between gusts at different levels is non-homogeneous and strongly modulated by the vertical stability of the atmosphere.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently reported by these patients and are often mistaken by physicians as functional gastrointestinal disorders. This syndrome can be diagnosed by the medical history and measurable biomarkers. Gastroenterologists manage diseases associated with active inflammatory cells including neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. The mast cell has only recently been recognized as a major player in our specialty. Gastrointestinal disorders from mast cell mediators often present with apparent irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia, chronic or cyclical nausea, and heartburn. Individuals with mast cell activation syndrome experience significant delays in diagnosis. The gastrointestinal symptoms are often refractory to symptom-targeted prescription medications. Beyond avoiding triggers, the best therapy is directed at modulating mast cell activation and the effects of the mediators. Many of these therapies are simple over-the-counter medications. In this article, we review mast cell function and dysfunction and the gastrointestinal symptoms, comorbid conditions, diagnosis, and management of mast cell activation syndrome. Gastroenterologists who become aware of this syndrome can dramatically improve the quality of life for their patients who previously have been labeled with a functional gastrointestinal disorder.

As part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) - Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), it shares the broader goals of providing a model evaluation and climate projection framework and improving communication with both the General Circulation Model (GCM) and climate data user communities. EURO-CORDEX oversees the design and coordination of ongoing ensembles of regional climate projections of unprecedented size and resolution (0.11 degrees EUR-11 and 0.44 degrees EUR-44 domains). Additionally, the inclusion of empirical-statistical downscaling allows investigation of much larger multi-model ensembles. These complementary approaches provide a foundation for scientific studies within the climate research community and others. The value of the EURO-CORDEX ensemble is shown via numerous peer-reviewed studies and its use in the development of climate services. Evaluations of the EUR-44 and EUR-11 ensembles also show the benefits of higher resolution. However, significant challenges remain. To further advance scientific understanding, two flagship pilot studies (FPS) were initiated. The first investigates local-regional phenomena at convection-permitting scales over central Europe and the Mediterranean in collaboration with the Med-CORDEX community. The second investigates the impacts of land cover changes on European climate across spatial and temporal scales. Over the coming years, the EURO-CORDEX community looks forward to closer collaboration with other communities, new advances, supporting international initiatives such as the IPCC reports, and continuing to provide the basis for research on regional climate impacts and adaptation in Europe.

J	Malerba, D				Malerba, Daniele			The Trade-off Between Poverty Reduction and Carbon Emissions, and the Role of Economic Growth and Inequality: An Empirical Cross-Country Analysis Using a Novel Indicator	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Poverty; Emissions; Sustainable development indicators; Trade-offs; De-growth; Inequality	INCOME INEQUALITY; PRO-POOR; PANEL; ENERGY	Is it possible for countries to eradicate poverty while also meeting environmental goals? Despite the passage of international agreements calling for these issues to be addressed simultaneously, little is known about the direct relationship between them. This study addresses this gap by proposing a new and composite indicator that integrates measures for both poverty and environmental outcomes (carbon emissions) into a single variable, the carbon intensity of poverty reduction (CIPR). This variable defines the trade-off between the proportional changes of emissions per capita and of the share of the population above the poverty line. In parallel an analytic framework is developed to formulate propositions concerning the possible effects of growth and inequality on the CIPR. The propositions are tested empirically using data from 135 countries across a 30-year time period (1981-2012). The findings confirm that the carbon intensity of poverty reduction is heterogeneous across countries. This heterogeneity is partly explained by economic growth, which is found to have a negative effect on the CIPR up to a certain income level, defined here as a "turning point". Above that turning point, economic growth increases the CIPR. By contrast, inequality reduction is shown to have a significant negative effect on the CIPR. This study contributes to the literature on sustainable development by analytically and quantitatively linking its three dimensions (social, economic and environmental) and by employing a composite indicator that directly measures the trade-off between poverty reduction and emission levels across countries.

A method for developing primary SC cultures from these mice was established, validated and successfully characterized via polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence (IF), and Western blots (WB). It was evident that both knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) primary cell cultures were similar in morphology. These highly pure SC cultures were subjected to cell proliferation assays indicating no notable proliferation in cultures of both genotypes. Measurements of cell monolayer integrity indicated significant increases in transepithelial electrical resistance and consequently in tight junction expression of the KO cultures. Using semi-quantitative WB and IF, tight junction protein claudin-11 was analyzed. These results support a role for Cx43 in regulating blood-testis barrier (BTB) function, composition, and dynamics in vitro. Thus, the SC deficient Cx43 cell cultures may provide a valuable in vitro tool for a better understanding of the mechanistic role of Cx43 in spermatogenesis and BTB assembly.

Findings from the Integrated Palliative Care in cancer and chronic conditions (InSup-C) study, which aimed to identify best practice in integrated palliative care in cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure, led to recommendations developed through an expert consultation process. We also wanted to develop these recommendations further with participants who were largely clinicians and members of the public. Methods Results from the InSup-C study were disseminated through a three-week massive open online course (MOOC) which ran in 2016, 2017 and 2019. The first course helped develop the final recommendations, which were ranked by MOOC participants in the subsequent courses. MOOC participants were predominantly clinicians, but also academics and members of the public. They rated how important each recommendation was on a 9 point scale (9 most important). Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the ratings. The results were compared to findings from the consultation. Results Five hundred fifteen completed the last part of the course where the recommendations were ranked, of which 195 (38%) completed the ratings. The top recommendations related to: need to expand palliative care to non-malignant conditions; palliative care needs to include different dimensions of care including physical, psychological and spiritual; policies and regulations assessments should be made regularly; palliative care integration should be mandatory; and there should be greater availability of medicines. These differed compared to the top ranked recommendations by the consultation panel in relation to the importance of leadership and policy making. This may indicate that clinicians are more focused on daily care rather than the (inter) national agenda. Conclusions Whilst both sets of recommendations are important, our study shows that we need to include the views of clinicians and the public rather than rely upon leading expert opinion alone. To keep recommendations fresh we need both the input of clinicians, the public and experts. When disseminating findings, MOOCs offer a useful way to gain greater reach with clinicians and the public, and importantly could be a vehicle to validate recommendations made by leading expert panels.

Molecular-level structure and dynamics at these interfaces are key for understanding many chemical/physical/atmospheric processes including the slipperiness of ice surfaces, the surface tension of water, and evaporation/sublimation of water. Sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the molecular-level structure of these interfaces because SFG can specifically probe the topmost interfacial water molecules separately from the bulk and is sensitive to molecular conformation. Nevertheless, experimental SFG has several limitations. For example, SFG cannot provide information on the depth of the interface and how the orientation of the molecules varies with distance from the surface. By combining the SFG spectroscopy with simulation techniques, one can directly compare the experimental data with the simulated SFG spectra, allowing us to unveil the molecular-level structure of water-air and ice-air interfaces. Here, we present an overview of the different simulation protocols available for SFG spectra calculations. We systematically compare the SFG spectra computed with different approaches, revealing the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods. Furthermore, we account for the findings through combined SFG experiments and simulations and provide future challenges for SFG experiments and simulations at different aqueous interfaces.

The objective of this work, as part of a master thesis, was to investigate and review current knowledge on the process of ice crystallization and endogenous plant protection mechanisms. The process of ice formation or crystallization depends on the availability of antifreeze proteins (AFP) and ice nucleation active substances (INAS), which anchor on the membrane of INAS bacteria. INAS such as small sand and dirt particles, tiny mineral crystals and INAS bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Erwinia can serve as nucleotides for ice nucleation and crystallization. Without ice nucleotides, water exhibits the capacity of supercooling; in the 0 to -5 & x202f;degrees C temperature range, supercooling is prevented by the presence of INAS bacteria, which become ultimately responsible for the tissue damage. Flowers of fruit trees with bacteria have been reported to freeze at -2 & x202f;degrees C compared with -5 & x202f;degrees C without Pseudomonas as INAS bacteria. When the ice crystals penetrate the plant via the cells, intra-cellular ice formation causes the freezing or frost damage. Small, irregularly shaped intra-cellular ice crystals are supposedly harmless to the cell, particularly if they melt before reaching (and damaging) the cell wall. Rapid freezing prevents the water to diffuse out of the cells to extra-cellular sites, results in a large number of small harmless ice crystals, whereas slow freezing ends up in a small number of large harmful ice crystals. Cold tolerance can include the following physiological mechanisms for frost hardiness, which can prevent or reduce intra-cellular ice formation (freezing) 1) Reduction of (free and unbound) water content including free water bound to dedicated proteins (dehydrins) in the cold period 2) Accumulation of osmotically active substances such as sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose, sorbitol), minerals (potassium etc.) and amino acids (proline etc.). 3) Availability of antifreeze proteins (AFP), which bind to the surface of the ice crystals and positively influence their size, shape and growth, thereby preventing them from penetrating the plant cell 4) Supercooling, a process, which prevents intra-cellular ice formation (frost damage) by preventing the formation of ice nucleotides 5) Structural ice barrier-no connection to the xylem tissues 6) Delayed flowering and time difference between flowering on one or two-year-old wood Effective functioning of these natural endogenous plant protection mechanisms in winter requires slow cold acclimation in autumn and their maintenance in spring. Overall, the challenge for future fruit breeding, selection and growing in a situation with late spring frosts due to climate change is a) to encourage these above endogenous physiological cold hardiness mechanisms in the orchard and b) to maintain them, as they are otherwise lost with increasing temperatures and concomitant bud break and bud scale unfolding during de-acclimation in spring.

J	Barth, U				Barth, U.			LAA occluder versus oral anticoagulation in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in clinical trials: What is the evidence?	KARDIOLOGE			German	Article; Early Access						BfArM; Thromboembolism; Complication rates; Cerebral insult; Watchman	APPENDAGE CLOSURE; STROKE PREVENTION; WATCHMAN DEVICE; SAFETY; EFFICACY; WARFARIN; OUTCOMES; CONTRAINDICATION; OBLITERATION; OCCLUSION	Background Left atrial appendage occluders (LAAO) so far have only a class II b B recommendation according to the European guideline for the prophylaxis of cerebral insults in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, e.g. in patients with contraindications for long-term administration of oral anticoagulants, which are the gold standard for thromboembolic prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation with a preference for novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC). The study compared the safety and efficacy of LAAO with oral anticoagulants in clinical trials. Methods The complication rates (e.g. bleeding, ischemic insult) in clinical studies with LAAO and oral anticoagulants were assessed on the basis of a literature analysis (2010-2019) and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) database (serious adverse events, SAE reports). Results In the literature analysis the special risks of LAAO (e.g. pericardial effusion) are visible. In some Watchman studies there was a reduced risk of cerebral insults comparable to warfarin. The evaluation of the BfArM database (Watchman registry with completed 5-year follow-up) showed, for example, some of the patients with device related thrombus of 2,6% for the registry (n & x202f;= 1 of these patients with subsequent cerebral insult, mean follow-up duration of the registry 50.1 months). The proportion of patients with ischemic insults in relation to the patients included in the registry was 5.3% (event rate 1.30 per 100 patient-years), with hemorrhagic insult 0.7% (event rate 0.17 per 100 patient-years), cardiovascular and unexplained mortality 7.1% (event rate 1.69 per 100 patient-years) and total mortality 17.8% (event rate 4.27 per 100 patient-years). Conclusion The LAAO provide the advantage that after endothelialization anticoagulants can sometimes be dispensed with and can therefore be used in patients with increased bleeding risks. The study review (analysis of the BfArM database and scientific literature) confirmed the clinical evidence regarding an overall safe use of the Watchman MP in clinical studies.

A better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of the CD28 superfamily members CD28, CTLA-4, and ICOS and their B7 ligands, CD80 and CD86, could support the development of biomarkers for response prediction to anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. We investigated methylation of the encoding genes CD28, CTLA4, ICOS, CD80, and CD86 at single CpG resolution (51 CpG sites) in a cohort of HNSCC (N = 528) and normal adjacent tissue samples (N = 50) provided by The Cancer Genome Research Atlas, in isolated blood leukocytes from healthy individuals (N = 28), and HNSCC cell lines (N = 39). We analysed methylation levels with regard to mRNA expression, overall survival, mutational load, interferon-gamma signature, and signatures of immune cell infiltrates. Depending on the location of the CpG sites (promoter, promoter flank, gene body, and intergenic sites), we found significant differences in methylation levels among isolated leukocytes, between leukocytes and HNSCC cell lines, and among HNSCCs. Methylation of all analysed genes correlated inversely or positively with mRNA expression, depending on the CpG site. CD28, CTLA4, and ICOS revealed almost identical correlation patterns. Furthermore, we found significant correlations with survival and features of response to immunotherapy, i.e. interferon-gamma signature, signatures of tumour infiltrating immune cells, and mutational load. Our results suggest CD28, CTLA4, ICOS, CD80, and CD86 expression levels are epigenetically co-regulated by DNA methylation. This study provides rationale to test their DNA methylation as potential biomarker for prediction of response to CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors.

There are many examples of this in the literature, and we strengthen the evidence by showing that, in the RoboPol monitoring program, n pi rotations occur more frequently than otherwise expected by chance. We explain this using a model consisting of two polarized emission components: a "jet" that is constant in time and a "burst" that is variable. The EVPA of the combination is EVPA(jet) at both the beginning and the end of the burst, so the net rotation across the burst must be n pi. Several examples of this model are analyzed on the Stokes plane, where the winding number for the Stokes vector of the combination gives the value of n. The main conclusion is that the EVPA rotation can be much larger than the physical rotation of the emission region around the axis of the jet, but this requires the EVPAs of the jet and the burst to be nearly orthogonal. Shock-in-jet calculations can provide a physical model for our toy model and in addition they automatically give the required orthogonality. The model is illustrated with data from the literature on OJ 287. We suggest that the large rapid EVPA rotation seen in OJ 287 might be a phase effect and not representative of a physical rotation.

Euclid: Nonparametric point spread function field recovery through interpolation on a graph Laplacian & x22c6;	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						cosmology; observations; gravitational lensing; weak; methods; numerical; techniques; image processing	SYSTEMATIC-ERRORS; SHEAR ESTIMATION; LENSING ANALYSIS; DARK ENERGY; WEAK; REQUIREMENTS; SEXTRACTOR	Context. Future weak lensing surveys, such as the Euclid mission, will attempt to measure the shapes of billions of galaxies in order to derive cosmological information. These surveys will attain very low levels of statistical error, and systematic errors must be extremely well controlled. In particular, the point spread function (PSF) must be estimated using stars in the field, and recovered with high accuracy. Aims. The aims of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we took steps toward a nonparametric method to address the issue of recovering the PSF field, namely that of finding the correct PSF at the position of any galaxy in the field, applicable to Euclid. Our approach relies solely on the data, as opposed to parametric methods that make use of our knowledge of the instrument. Secondly, we studied the impact of imperfect PSF models on the shape measurement of galaxies themselves, and whether common assumptions about this impact hold true in an Euclid scenario. Methods. We extended the recently proposed resolved components analysis approach, which performs super-resolution on a field of under-sampled observations of a spatially varying, image-valued function. We added a spatial interpolation component to the method, making it a true 2-dimensional PSF model. We compared our approach to PSFEx, then quantified the impact of PSF recovery errors on galaxy shape measurements through image simulations. Results. Our approach yields an improvement over PSFEx in terms of the PSF model and on observed galaxy shape errors, though it is at present far from reaching the required Euclid accuracy. We also find that the usual formalism used for the propagation of PSF model errors to weak lensing quantities no longer holds in the case of an Euclid-like PSF. In particular, different shape measurement approaches can react differently to the same PSF modeling errors.	[Schmitz, M.

A more precise characterization of the environment will allow a better dealing with genotype-by-environment-by-management interactions. Therefore, space and time dependencies of the crop production processes have to be considered. The use of novel sensor technologies has drastically increased the amount and diversity of phenotypic data from agronomic field trials. Existing data management systems either do not consider space and time, are not customizable to individual needs such as field trial handling, or have restricted availability. Hence, we propose an integrative data management and information system (DMIS) for handling of traditional and novel sensor-based phenotypic, environmental and management data. The DMIS must be customizable, applicable and scalable from individual users to organizations. Results Key element of the system is a dynamic PostgreSQL database with GIS-extension, capable of importing, storing and managing all types of data including images. The database references every structural database object and measurement in a threefold approach with semantic, spatial and temporal reference. Timestamps and geo-coordinates allow automated linking of all data. Traits can be precisely defined individually or uploaded as predefined lists. Filtering and selection routines allow compilation of all data for visualization via tables, charts or maps and for export and external statistical analysis. New possibilities of environmental information-based planning of field trials, weather-guided phenotyping and data analysis for outlier or hot-spot detection are demonstrated. Conclusions The DMIS supports users in handling experimental field trials with crop plants and modern phenotyping methods. It focuses on linking all space and time dependent processes of plant production. Weather, soil and management, as well as growth and yield formation of the plants can be depicted, thus allowing a more precise interpretation of the results in relation to environment and management. Breeders, extension specialists, official testing agencies and agricultural scientists are assisted in all steps of a typical workflow with planning, designing, conducting, controlling and analyzing field trials to generate new information for decision support in the crop improvement process.

For several beta-amyloid and first-generation tau-PET radiotracers, it has been shown that early-phase images can be used as a surrogate of neuronal injury. Therefore, we investigated the performance of early acquisitions of the novel tau-PET radiotracer [F-18]PI-2620 as a potential substitute for [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose ([F-18]FDG). Methods Twenty-six subjects were referred with suspected tauopathies or overlapping parkinsonian syndromes (Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, multi-system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, multi-system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia) and received a dynamic [F-18]PI-2620 tau-PET (0-60 min p.i.) and static [F-18]FDG-PET (30-50 min p.i.). Regional standardized uptake value ratios of early-phase images (single frame SUVr) and the blood flow estimate (R-1) of [F-18]PI-2620-PET were correlated with corresponding quantification of [F-18]FDG-PET (global mean/cerebellar normalization). Reduced tracer uptake in cortical target regions was also interpreted visually using 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projections by three more and three less experienced readers. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated between early-phase [F-18]PI-2620 tau-PET and [F-18]FDG-PET images for all cortical regions and frequencies of disagreement between images were compared for both more and less experienced readers. Results Highest agreement with [F-18]FDG-PET quantification was reached for [F-18]PI-2620-PET acquisition from 0.5 to 2.5 min p.i. for global mean (lowest R = 0.69) and cerebellar scaling (lowest R = 0.63). Correlation coefficients (summed 0.5-2.5 min SUVr & R-1) displayed strong agreement in all cortical target regions for global mean (R-SUVr 0.76, R-R1 = 0.77) and cerebellar normalization (R-SUVr 0.68, R-R1 = 0.68). Visual interpretation revealed high regional correlations between early-phase tau-PET and [F-18]FDG-PET. There were no relevant differences between more and less experienced readers. Conclusion Early-phase imaging of [F-18]PI-2620 can serve as a surrogate biomarker for neuronal injury. Dynamic imaging or a dual time-point protocol for tau-PET imaging could supersede additional [F-18]FDG-PET imaging by indexing both the distribution of tau and the extent of neuronal injury.

Understanding movements in world sugar prices helps policy-makers and participants in the sugar value chain to formulate effective investment strategies and forecast the effects of market shocks more accurately. We combine a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) technique to address specification uncertainty with an out-of-sample analysis to evaluate price predictability. Results show that world sugar quotations are mostly influenced by their own dynamics, changes in international staple food prices, sugar production costs, and macroeconomic variables. The predictability of the BMA is found to be generally high, compared with a sample of benchmark time series approaches.

Disease activity-dependent expression of nerve growth factor TRKA and P75 receptors on elevated dendritic cells and peripheral leucocytes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus	LUPUS			English	Article; Early Access						Systemic lupus erythematosus; NGF receptors; dendritic cells		Introduction The nervous system modulates rheumatic diseases in neurogenic inflammation (NI). Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays a pivotal role in NI and chronic nociceptive pain. However, the role of NGF in autoimmune inflammatory diseases is not well understood. The aim of this study was to analyse NGF high- (TrkA) and low-affinity (p75) receptors on all major leucocyte subsets of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as a potential indicator of NI. Methods A total of 13 patients were analysed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and compared to 13 healthy control (HC) subjects. Patients were also stratified for high or low disease activity (CRP, ESR, SLEDAI, ANA, anti-dsDNA and C3/C4). Statistics included the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U-test. Results When comparing patients and HC, TrkA was not differentially expressed. In contrast, p75 was increased on CD16+ and CD56+ leucocytes in patients. CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC) were in total increased in SLE. DCs were also significantly elevated in active patients. Furthermore, we found an intermediate CD11b+ population strongly expressing TrkA in patients and HC. Conclusion We demonstrate for the first time differential NGF receptor expression in SLE. The increased CD11c+ DCs might indicate additional activation in SLE.

Molecular dating and fossils of their pancrustacean sister group predict that myriapods originated in the Cambrian, much earlier than their oldest known fossils, but uncertainty about stem group Myriapoda confounds efforts to resolve the timing of the group's terrestrialization. Among a small set of candidates for membership in the stem group of Myriapoda, the Cambrian to Triassic euthycarcinoids have repeatedly been singled out. The only known Devonian euthycarcinoid, Heterocrania rhyniensis from the Rhynie and Windyfield cherts hot spring complex in Scotland, reveals details of head structures that constrain the evolutionary position of euthycarcinoids. The head capsule houses an anterior cuticular tentorium, a feature uniquely shared by myriapods and hexapods. Confocal microscopy recovers myriapod-like characters of the preoral chamber, such as a prominent hypopharynx supported by tentorial bars and superlinguae between the mandibles and hypopharynx, reinforcing an alliance between euthycarcinoids and myriapods recovered in recent phylogenetic analysis. The Cambrian occurrence of the earliest euthycarcinoids supplies the oldest compelling evidence for an aquatic stem group for either Myriapoda or Hexapoda, previously a lacuna in the body fossil record of these otherwise terrestrial lineages until the Silurian and Devonian, respectively. The trace fossil record of euthycarcinoids in the Cambrian and Ordovician reveals amphibious locomotion in tidal environments and fills a gap between molecular estimates for myriapod origins in the Cambrian and a post-Ordovician crown group fossil record.

The Set7 Lysine Methyltransferase Regulates Plasticity in Oxidative Phosphorylation Necessary for Trained Immunity Induced by beta-Glucan	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION; REINFECTION; EPIGENETICS; PROTECTION; ENHANCERS	Trained immunity confers a sustained augmented response of innate immune cells to a secondary challenge, via a process dependent on metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming. Because of its previous associations with metabolic and transcriptional memory, as well as the importance of H3 histone lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) to innate immune memory, we hypothesize that the Set7 methyltransferase has an important role in trained immunity induced by beta-glucan. Using pharmacological studies of human primary monocytes, we identify trained immunity-specific immunometabolic pathways regulated by Set7, including a previously unreported H3K4me1-dependent plasticity in the induction of oxidative phosphorylation. Recapitulation of beta-glucan training in vivo additionally identifies Set7-dependent changes in gene expression previously associated with the modulation of myelopoiesis progenitors in trained immunity. By revealing Set7 as a key regulator of trained immunity, these findings provide mechanistic insight into sustained meta- bolic changes and underscore the importance of characterizing regulatory circuits of innate immune memory.

Timing performance of a Micro-Channel-Plate Photomultiplier Tube	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						MCP-PMT; Time resolution; Cherenkov light; Beam test; t0-reference; Monte-Carlo simulation	RESOLUTION	The spatial dependence of the timing performance of the R3809U-50 Micro-Channel-Plate PMT (MCP-PMT) by Hamamatsu was studied in high energy muon beams. Particle position information is provided by a GEM tracker telescope, while timing is measured relative to a second MCP-PMT, identical in construction. In the inner part of the circular active area (radius r<5.5 mm) the time resolution of the two MCP-PMTS combined is better than 10 ps. The signal amplitude decreases in the outer region due to less light reaching the photocathode, resulting in a worse time resolution. The observed radial dependence is in quantitative agreement with a dedicated simulation. With this characterization, the suitability of MCP-PMTS as t(0) reference detectors has been validated.

For the first time, signal height, signal width, and homogeneity of the response of these Cherenkov radiators were determined for energies between 10 and 14 MeV. To complement the beam tests, optical properties of the materials, in particular measured transmittances in the near UV and visible spectrum, were studied. The measured detector responses were also compared to Monte Carlo simulations of energy-loss, light production, transport, and detection. These Cherenkov radiators are considered as active material of a low-energy calorimeter for the detection of light dark matter particles recoiling off electrons behind the beam-dump of the Mainz Energy Recovering Superconducting Accelerator MESA.

A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						Cropping systems; Cultivation method; Diversity; Experiments; Resilience; Simplification; Specialisation	FARMING SYSTEMS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PLANT DIVERSITY; GRAIN LEGUMES; COVER CROPS; LAND-USE; BIODIVERSITY; SOIL; INTENSIFICATION; SUSTAINABILITY	Agricultural intensification increased crop productivity but simplified production with lower diversity of cropping systems, higher genetic uniformity, and a higher uniformity of agricultural landscapes. Associated detrimental effects on the environment and biodiversity as well as the resilience and adaptability of cropping systems to climate change are of growing concern. Crop diversification may stabilize productivity of cropping systems and reduce negative environmental impacts and loss of biodiversity, but a shared understanding of crop diversification including approaches towards a more systematic research is lacking. Here, we review the use of 'crop diversification' measures in agricultural research. We (i) analyse changes in crop diversification studies over time; (ii) identify diversification practices based on empirical studies; (iii) differentiate their use by country, crop species and experimental setup and (iv) identify target parameters to assess the success of diversification. Our main findings are that (1) less than 5% of the selected studies on crop diversification refer to our search term 'diversification'; (2) more than half of the studies focused on rice, corn or wheat; (3) 76% of the experiments were conducted in India, USA, Canada, Brazil or China; (4) almost any arable crop was tested on its suitability for diversification; (5) in 72% of the studies on crop diversification, at least one additional agronomic measure was tested and (6) only 45% of the studies analysed agronomic, economic and ecological target variables. Our findings show the high variability of approaches to crop diversification and the lack of a consistent theoretical concept. For better comparability and ability to generalise the results of the different primary studies, we suggest a novel conceptual framework. It consists of five elements, (i) definition of the problem of existing farming practices and the potential need for diversification, (ii) characterisation of the baseline system to be diversified, (iii) definition of the scale and target area, (iv) description of the experimental design and target variables and (v) definition of the expected impacts. Applying this framework will contribute to utilizing the benefits of crop diversification more efficiently.

They characterize the oscillations exhibiting interregional coordination and identify an important orchestrating role for hippocampal slow oscillations. During sleep, new memories undergo a gradual transfer from hippocampal (HPC) to neocortical (NC) sites. Precisely timed neural oscillations are thought to mediate this sleep-dependent memory consolidation, but exactly how sleep oscillations instantiate the HPC-NC dialog remains elusive. Employing overnight invasive electroencephalography in ten neurosurgical patients, we identified three broad classes of phase-based communication between HPC and lateral temporal NC. First, we observed interregional phase synchrony for non-rapid eye movement (NREM) spindles, and N2 and rapid eye movement (REM) theta activity. Second, we found asymmetrical N3 cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling between HPC slow oscillations (SOs) and NC activity spanning the delta to high-gamma/ripple bands, but not in the opposite direction. Lastly, N2 theta and NREM spindle synchrony were themselves modulated by HPC SOs. These forms of interregional communication emphasize the role of HPC SOs in the HPC-NC dialog, and may offer a physiological basis for the sleep-dependent reorganization of mnemonic content.

We establish explicit estimates for various quantities related to phi that are uniform in lambda(phi). This includes uniform bounds for spherical Whittaker functions on GL(n)(Double-struck capital R), uniform bounds for the global sup-norm of phi, and uniform bounds for the "essential support" of phi, i.e., the region outside which it decays exponentially. The proofs combine analytic and arithmetic tools.

J	Klein, N; Schmitz, L; Wintrich, T; Sander, PM				Klein, Nicole; Schmitz, Lars; Wintrich, Tanja; Sander, P. Martin			A new cymbospondylid ichthyosaur (Ichthyosauria) from the Middle Triassic (Anisian) of the Augusta Mountains, Nevada, USA	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						skull morphology; phylogeny; new species; fetus; cymbospondylid diversity	LIFE-HISTORY; REPTILIA; ORIGIN; ICHTHYOPTERYGIA; PHYLOGENY; OSTEOLOGY; DIAPSIDA; SKULL	A new taxon, Cymbospondylus duelferi sp. nov., is described from the late Anisian of the Fossil Hill Member of the Favret Formation of the Augusta Mountains, Pershing County, Nevada, USA. The holotype and only specimen consists of a fairly complete skull associated with articulated and disarticulated postcranial material. Body length reconstruction revealed a medium-sized individual with an estimated body length of 4.3 m. Dorsal vertebrae as well as the left humerus of this specimen are associated with three strings of articulated tail and posterior dorsal vertebrae, which are on average 68% smaller than the vertebrae of the medium-sized individual. Due to the small size of these vertebrae and their position within the trunk region, they most likely represent fetuses. Cymbospondylus duelferi sp. nov. provides the second-oldest evidence for viviparity in ichthyosaurs. In the course of this study, the skull morphology of C. petrinus and C. nichollsi was reviewed, resulting in revised character scorings for both. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate a sister-taxon relationship of the new taxon with C. petrinus, which was found in the same stratigraphic unit, the Fossil Hill Member, that also crops out at the classical Fossil Hill locality in the Humboldt Range, where the member is part of the Prida Formation. Cymbospondylus duelferi sp. nov. shares a very similar skull morphology with C. petrinus and C. nichollsi, whereas the shoulder girdle morphology differs. Because there is no evidence for ontogenetic differences or sexual dimorphism in the new specimen, a third species of Cymbospondylus - neglecting the type species C. piscosus that is only known from five vertebrae - is recognized from the Fossil Hill Member. Further occurrences of the genus in the Lower and Middle Triassic of Svalbard (Boreal Ocean) and Europe (Tethys) point to a very fast radiation and dispersal of cymbospondylids during the Middle Triassic.

Resolving the dark matter of ABCA4 for 1054 Stargardt disease probands through integrated genomics and transcriptomics	GENETICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						ABCA4; Stargardt disease; smMIPs; deep-intronic variants; structural variants	MATERNAL UNIPARENTAL ISODISOMY; DEEP-INTRONIC VARIANTS; RETINAL DYSTROPHY; GENE; MUTATION; CHROMOSOME-1; PATIENT; REVEALS; REPAIR; RPE65	Purpose Missing heritability in human diseases represents a major challenge, and this is particularly true for ABCA4-associated Stargardt disease (STGD1). We aimed to elucidate the genomic and transcriptomic variation in 1054 unsolved STGD and STGD-like probands. Methods Sequencing of the complete 128-kb ABCA4 gene was performed using single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs), based on a semiautomated and cost-effective method. Structural variants (SVs) were identified using relative read coverage analyses and putative splice defects were studied using in vitro assays. Results In 448 biallelic probands 14 known and 13 novel deep-intronic variants were found, resulting in pseudoexon (PE) insertions or exon elongations in 105 alleles. Intriguingly, intron 13 variants c.1938-621G>A and c.1938-514G>A resulted in dual PE insertions consisting of the same upstream, but different downstream PEs. The intron 44 variant c.6148-84A>T resulted in two PE insertions and flanking exon deletions. Eleven distinct large deletions were found, two of which contained small inverted segments. Uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 1 was identified in one proband. Conclusion Deep sequencing of ABCA4 and midigene-based splice assays allowed the identification of SVs and causal deep-intronic variants in 25% of biallelic STGD1 cases, which represents a model study that can be applied to other inherited diseases.

ALICE Collaboration	Global polarization of Lambda and (Lambda)over-bar hyperons in Pb-Pb collisions at root s(NN)=2.76 and 5.02 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW C			English	Article							FLOW	The global polarization of the Lambda and (Lambda) over bar hyperons is measured for Pb-Pb collisions at root s(NN) = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV recorded with the ALICE at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The results are reported differentially as a function of collision centrality and hyperon's transverse momentum (pT) for the range of centrality 5-50%, 0.5 < pT < 5 GeV/c, and rapidity vertical bar y vertical bar < 0.5. The hyperon global polarization averaged for Pb-Pb collisions at root s(NN) = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV is found to be consistent with zero, < P-H > (%) approximate to 0.01 +/- 0.06 (stat.) +/- 0.03 (syst.) in the collision centrality range 15-50%, where the largest signal is expected. The results are compatible with expectations based on an extrapolation from measurements at lower collision energies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, hydrodynamical model calculations, and empirical estimates based on collision energy dependence of directed flow, all of which predict the global polarization values at LHC energies of the order of 0.01%.

J	Ayeb-Karlsson, S; Kniveton, D; Cannon, T				Ayeb-Karlsson, Sonja; Kniveton, Dominic; Cannon, Terry			Trapped in the prison of the mind: Notions of climate-induced (im)mobility decision-making and wellbeing from an urban informal settlement in Bangladesh	PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							Q-METHODOLOGY; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; HEALTH OUTCOMES; MENTAL-HEALTH; MIGRATION; SLUMS; DHAKA; PREVALENCE; DISCOURSES; MIGRANTS	The concept of Trapped Populations has until date mainly referred to people 'trapped' in environmentally high-risk rural areas due to economic constraints. This article attempts to widen our understanding of the concept by investigating climate-induced socio-psychological immobility and its link to Internally Displaced People's (IDPs) wellbeing in a slum of Dhaka. People migrated here due to environmental changes back on Bhola Island and named the settlement Bhola Slum after their home. In this way, many found themselves 'immobile' after having been mobile-unable to move back home, and unable to move to other parts of Dhaka, Bangladesh, or beyond. The analysis incorporates the emotional and psychosocial aspects of the diverse immobility states. Mind and emotion are vital to better understand people's (im)mobility decision-making and wellbeing status. The study applies an innovative and interdisciplinary methodological approach combining Q-methodology and discourse analysis (DA). This mixed-method illustrates a replicable approach to capture the complex state of climate-induced (im)mobility and its interlinkages to people's wellbeing. People reported facing non-economic losses due to the move, such as identity, honour, sense of belonging and mental health. These psychosocial processes helped explain why some people ended up 'trapped' or immobile. The psychosocial constraints paralysed them mentally, as well as geographically. More empirical evidence on how climate change influences people's wellbeing and mental health will be important to provide us with insights in how to best support vulnerable people having faced climatic impacts, and build more sustainable climate policy frameworks.

This study examined the area and individual-level determinants of prescription opioid use in Finland during the period 1995-2016. Design Logistic regression analysis using nation-wide data on filled opioid-related prescriptions dispensed at Finnish pharmacies and covered by National Health Insurance. Opioid consumption was linked, using personal identification codes, to population-based data maintained by Statistics Finland, which records individual background and area-level characteristics. Setting and participants Working-age population aged between 15 and 64 years in Finland during the periods 1995-2007 (n = 4 315 409) and 2009-16 (n = 4 116 992). Measurements Annual prescription opioid use was measured using defined daily doses (DDD) and whether people used opioids during a year. Findings Prescription opioid use increased in Finland from 1995 to 2016 (from less than 1 to 7%), but the increase was explained by the change in the treatment of codeine-based opioids in National Health Insurance. The area-level unemployment rate was positively correlated with the share of opioid users at the municipal level (r = 0.36; P < 0.001). In comparison with being employed, being outside the labour force was associated with increased opioid use in 1995-2007 [odds ratio (OR) = 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.10-2.36] and non-codeine opioid use in 2009-16 (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 2.06-2.27), but not with codeine opioid use in 2009-16. Conclusions Prescription opioid use in Finland appears to be more common among low socio-economic status people, similar to the United States and the United Kingdom.

For structurally related series, SARMs also produce virtual candidate compounds. Hence, SARM represents a unique computational approach establishing a direct link between SAR visualization and compound design. The SARM data structure is reminiscent of R-group tables and hence easily accessible from a chemical perspective, although the underlying algorithmic basis is complex. The SARM concept has been extended in different ways to further increase its analytical and design capacity. While the efforts were largely driven from a research perspective, they have also increased the utility for practical applications. Among others, extensions include approaches for SARM-based compound activity prediction, the generation of a large SARM database for analog searching, and the design of a deep learning architecture for advanced analog design taking chemical space information for target families into account. Herein, the SARM approach and its extensions are discussed within their scientific context.

On the other hand, elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) can enhance the yield of vegetables that are more nutrient-demanding compared to grain crops. Therefore, it is expected that vegetables would respond in another way to eCO(2) and interact with environmental changes differently. In this study, we reviewed the effect of eCO(2) on yield and yield components of vegetables by a meta-analysis using 107 selected articles. Elevated CO2 (827 mu mol mol(-1)) increased yield of vegetables as a whole by 34% (n = 8877) but did not affect the dry matter content. Elevated CO2 increased the harvest index by 23% whilst it increased the root to shoot biomass ratio by 8%. The increased vegetable yield was associated with increased vegetable number of the organs largely by 32% and vegetable mass to a lesser extent (11%). The least increases in the mass of fruit vegetables (10%) could be the reason for the least yield improvement (30%, n = 5778) when compared to leafy vegetables, stem vegetables, root vegetables and flower vegetables. In addition, the effect of eCO(2) on yield tended to differ between the levels of temperature, light, water and N availability, with the differences being greater than those of salinity, O-3 and N form. Drought stress appears to be a major constraint limiting the increases in number and yield of vegetables under eCO(2). We conclude that environments have to be optimized to improve the yield benefit from high CO2 for a sustainable vegetable production. In scenarios of high CO2 environment, due to climate change, a "wise use" of atmospheric CO2, without implementing an extra source for CO2 is a good step for a cleaner vegetable production.

Since they take the relation of logical consequence to reside at the very heart of a logical system, different relations of logical consequence yield different logics. In this paper, we are especially interested in understanding what are the consequences of endorsing Beall and Restall's version of logical pluralism vis-a-vis the normative guidance that logic is taken to provide to reasoners. In particular, the aim of this paper is threefold. First, in Sections 2 and 3, we offer an exegesis of Beall and Restall's logical pluralism as a thesis of semantic indeterminacy of our concept of logical consequence - i.e. understood as indeterminacy logical pluralism. Second, in Sections 4 and 5, we elaborate and critically scrutinize three models of semantic indeterminacy that we think are fit to capture Beall and Restall's indeterminacy logical pluralism. Third, in Section 6, following Beall and Restall's assumption that the notion of logical consequence has normative significance for deductive reasoning, we raise a series of normative problems for indeterminacy logical pluralism. The overall conclusion that we aim to establish is that Beall and Restall's indeterminate logical pluralism cannot offer an adequate account of the normative guidance that logic is taken to provide us with in ordinary contexts of reasoning.

J	Stei, E				Stei, Erik			Rivalry, normativity, and the collapse of logical pluralism	INQUIRY-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						Logical pluralism; collapse problem; normativity; logical consequence		Logical pluralism is the view that there is more than one correct logic. This very general characterization gives rise to a whole family of positions. I argue that not all of them are stable. The main argument in the paper is inspired by considerations known as the "collapse problem", and it aims at the most popular form of logical pluralism advocated by JC Beall and Greg Restall. I argue that there is a more general argument available that challenges all variants of logical pluralism that meet the following three conditions: (i) that there are at least two correct logical systems characterized in terms of different consequence relations, (ii) that there is some sort of rivalry among the correct logics, and (iii) that logical consequence is normative. The hypothesis I argue for amounts to conditional claim: If a position satisfies all these conditions, then that position is unstable in the sense that it collapses into competing positions.

Monitoring data are, however, lacking in many countries, allegedly because of capacity challenges of less-developed countries. So far, however, the relationship between human development and capacity challenges for water quality monitoring have not been analysed systematically. This hinders the implementation of fine-tuned capacity development programmes for water quality monitoring. Against this background, this study takes a global perspective in analysing the link between human development and the capacity challenges countries face in their national water quality monitoring programmes. The analysis is based on the latest data on the human development index and an international online survey amongst experts from science and practice. Results provide evidence of a negative relationship between human development and the capacity challenges to meet SDG 6.3.2 monitoring requirements. This negative relationship increases along the course of the monitoring process, from defining the enabling environment, choosing parameters for the collection of field data, to the analytics and analysis of five commonly used parameters (DO, EC, pH, TP and TN). Our assessment can be used to help practitioners improve technical capacity development activities and to identify and target investment in capacity development for monitoring.

Results Mean age was 76.1 +/- 8.3 years, patients were male in 57.7% and presented with a high risk for thromboembolism (CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc: 4.3 +/- 1.1). At thrombus diagnosis, 44.9% patients were treated with a NOAC, while 41.0% were under therapy with a VKA. Complete thrombus resolution was achieved after a mean of 116 +/- 79 days in a total of 51.3% of patients, 35.9% showed a reduction of thrombus size, whereas 12.8% showed no changes in thrombus dimensions. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of LAA thrombus resolution between VKA and NOACs (41.2 vs. 57.1%, p = 0.18). However, in cases in which only the therapy with a NOAC led to complete thrombus resolution, the time needed was significantly shorter than with VKA (81 +/- 38 vs. 129 +/- 46 days, p = 0.03). Regarding safety outcomes, no differences in bleeding or thromboembolism were observed between patients with and without thrombus resolution. Conclusions In this registry, approximately 85% of LAA thrombi were diagnosed in patients with ongoing OAC. Thrombus resolution was observed in nearly 50% of cases. Although there was no difference in the rate of LAA thrombus resolution between VKA and NOACs, the resolution time was shorter in patients prescribed a NOAC.

For Round 2 of its deliberations, cIMPACT-NOW Working Committee 3 was reconstituted and convened in Utrecht, The Netherlands, for a meeting designed to review putative new CNS tumor types in advance of any future World Health Organization meeting on CNS tumor classification. In preparatory activities for the meeting and at the actual meeting, a list of possible entities was assembled and each type and subtype debated. Working Committee 3 recommended that a substantial number of newly recognized types and subtypes should be considered for inclusion in future CNS tumor classifications. In addition, the group endorsed a number of principles-relating to classification categories, approaches to classification, nomenclature, and grading-that the group hopes will also inform the future classification of CNS neoplasms.

A frequently observed predatory strategy of Hydromys is sitting in wait at the water's edge with parts of its vibrissae submersed. Here we show that Hydromys can detect water motions with its whiskers. Behavioural thresholds range from 1.0 to 9.4 mm s(-1) water velocity, based on maximal horizontal water velocity in the area covered by the whiskers. This high sensitivity to water motions would enable Hydromys to detect fishes passing by. No responses to surface waves generated by a vibrating rod and resembling the surface waves caused by struggling insects were found.

J	Bohnlein, T; Kratsch, S; Schaudt, O				Boehnlein, Toni; Kratsch, Stefan; Schaudt, Oliver			Revenue maximization in Stackelberg Pricing Games: beyond the combinatorial setting	MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING			English	Article; Early Access						Algorithmic pricing; Stackelberg games; Approximation algorithms; Revenue maximization; Parameterized complexity	APPROXIMATION	In a Stackelberg Pricing Game a distinguished player, the leader, chooses prices for a set of items, and the other players, the followers, each seek to buy a minimum cost feasible subset of the items. The goal of the leader is to maximize her revenue, which is determined by the sold items and their prices. Most previously studied cases of such games can be captured by a combinatorial model where we have a base set of items, some with fixed prices, some priceable, and constraints on the subsets that are feasible for each follower. In this combinatorial setting, Briest et al. and Balcan et al. independently showed that the maximum revenue can be approximated to a factor of H-k similar to log k, where k is the number of priceable items. Our results are twofold. First, we strongly generalize the model by letting the follower minimize any continuous function plus a linear term over any compact subset of R->= 0(n); the coefficients (or prices) in the linear term are chosen by the leader and determine her revenue. In particular, this includes the fundamental case of linear programs. We give a tight lower bound on the revenue of the leader, generalizing the results of Briest et al. and Balcan et al. Besides, we prove that it is strongly NP-hard to decide whether the optimum revenue exceeds the lower bound by an arbitrarily small factor. Second, we study the parameterized complexity of computing the optimal revenue with respect to the number k of priceable items. In the combinatorial setting, given an efficient algorithm for optimal follower solutions, the maximum revenue can be found by enumerating the 2(k) subsets of priceable items and computing optimal prices via a result of Briest et al., giving time O(2(k) vertical bar I vertical bar(c)) where vertical bar I vertical bar is the input size. Our main result here is a W[1]-hardness proof for the case where the followers minimize a linear program, ruling out running time f (k)vertical bar I vertical bar(c) unless FPT = W[1] and ruling out time vertical bar I vertical bar(o(k)) under the Exponential-Time Hypothesis.

GPCRs are the largest family of membrane proteins encoded in the human genome and are the targets of about one-third of prescription medicines. However, to date, no single therapeutic agent exerts its effects via perturbing heterotrimeric G protein function, despite a plethora of evidence linking G protein malfunction to human disease. Several recent studies have brought to light that the G(q) family?specific inhibitor FR900359 (FR) is unexpectedly efficacious in silencing the signaling of G(q) oncoproteins, mutant G(q) variants that mostly exist in the active state. These data not only raise the hope that researchers working in drug discovery may be able to potentially strike G(q) oncoproteins from the list of undruggable targets, but also raise questions as to how FR achieves its therapeutic effect. Here, we place emphasis on these recent studies and explain why they expand our pharmacological armamentarium for targeting G(q) protein oncogenes as well as broaden our mechanistic understanding of G(q) protein oncogene function. We also highlight how this novel insight impacts the significance and utility of using G((q)) proteins as targets in drug discovery efforts.

In daily practice, exclusion of a hereditary PC deficiency is often based on a single determination of PC activity, by either clotting time-based or mostly chromogenic assay. However, diagnosis of hereditary PC deficiency is challenging due to several laboratory and clinical limitations. We compared the potential of PC activity values measured by either chromogenic or clotting time-based assay to predict a variation in the PROC gene. One hundred one (35%) of 287 patients carried variations within the PROC gene, including 2 previously not published variations. In 20 (20%) patients with identified variation, PC activity, determined by chromogenic assay, was within the reference range. For prediction of an underlying genetic defect determined by chromogenic and clotting time-based assay, sensitivity was 80% versus 99%, specificity 75% versus 18%, positive predictive value 64% versus 39%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 88% versus 97%. The lower NPV of chromogenic versus clotting time-based PC assay can be mainly explained by the presence of PC deficiency type IIb. Following our proposed diagnostic algorithm, additional measurement of PC activity by clotting time-based assay in case of a positive VTE history improves detection of this subtype of PC deficiency. Considering potential therapeutic consequences for primary and especially for secondary VTE prophylaxis, genetic analysis is required not only for confirmation but also for clarification of PC deficiency.

VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy of massive young stellar objects in the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: formation; stars: pre-main sequence; stars: massive; HII regions; galaxies: clusters: individual: 30 Doradus; Magellanic Clouds	POINT-SOURCE CLASSIFICATION; INTEGRAL FIELD SPECTROSCOPY; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; SPITZER LEGACY PROGRAM; STAR-FORMATION; INTERMEDIATE-MASS; PROTOSTELLAR CANDIDATES; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; CO OUTFLOWS; LIFE-CYCLE	The process of massive star (M >= 8 M-circle dot) formation is still poorly understood. Observations of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) are challenging due to their rarity, short formation timescale, large distances, and high circumstellar extinction. Here, we present the results of a spectroscopic analysis of a population of MYSOs in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We took advantage of the spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of X-shooter (300-2500 nm), which is mounted on the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, to detect characteristic spectral features in a dozen MYSO candidates near 30 Doradus, the largest starburst region in the Local Group hosting the most massive stars known. The X-shooter spectra are strongly contaminated by nebular emission. We used a scaling method to subtract the nebular contamination from our objects. We detect H alpha, beta, [OI] 630.0 nm, CaII, infrared triplet [FeII] 1643.5 nm, fluorescent FeII 1687.8 nm, H-2 2121.8 nm, Br gamma, and CO bandhead emission in the spectra of multiple candidates. This leads to the spectroscopic confirmation of ten candidates as bona fide MYSOs. We compared our observations with photometric observations from the literature and find all MYSOs to have a strong near-infrared excess. We computed lower limits to the brightness and luminosity of the MYSO candidates, confirming the near-infrared excess and the massive nature of the objects. No clear correlation is seen between the Br gamma luminosity and metallicity. Combining our sample with other LMC samples results in a combined detection rate of disk features, such as fluorescent FeII and CO bandheads, which is consistent with the Galactic rate (40%). Most of our MYSOs show outflow features.	[van Gelder, M. L.; Kaper, L.; Japelj, J.; Ramirez-Tannus, M. C.; Ellerbroek, L. E.; de Koter, A.; de Mink, S.

With the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions in orbit, considerable efforts are being made to evaluate derived soil moisture products via ground observations, microwave transfer simulation, and independent remote sensing retrievals. Due to the large footprint of the satellite radiometers of about 40 km in diameter and the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture, minimum sampling densities for soil moisture are required to challenge the targeted precision. Here we use 400 m resolution simulations with the regional Terrestrial System Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP) and its coupling with the Community Microwave Emission Modelling platform (CMEM) to quantify the maximum sampling distance allowed for soil moisture and brightness temperature validation. Our analysis suggests that an overall sampling distance of finer than 6 km is required to validate the targeted accuracy of 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3) with a 70 % confidence level in SMOS and SMAP estimates over typical mid-latitude European regions. The maximum allowed sampling distance depends on the land-surface heterogeneity and the meteorological situation, which influences the soil moisture patterns, and ranges from about 6 to 17 km for a 70 % confidence level for a typical year. At the maximum allowed sampling distance on a 70 % confidence level, the accuracy of footprint-averaged soil moisture is equal to or better than brightness temperature estimates over the same area. Estimates strongly deteriorate with larger sampling distances. For the evaluation of the smaller footprints of the active and active-passive products of SMAP the required sampling densities increase; e.g., when a grid resolution of 3 km diameter is sampled by three sites of footprints of 9 km sampled by five sites required, only 50 %-60 % of the pixels have a sampling error below the nominal values. The required minimum sampling densities for ground-based radiometer networks to estimate footprint-averaged brightness temperature are higher than for soil moisture due to the non-linearities of radiative transfer, and only weakly correlated in space and time. This study provides a basis for a better understanding of the sometimes strong mismatches between derived satellite soil moisture products and ground-based measurements.

In this article we study this transition more closely by choosing sigma 12=1 +/- t-alpha and sigma 22=1 -/+ t-alpha. We show that the logarithmic correction for the order of the maximum now smoothly interpolates between the correction in the i.i.d. case 122ln mml:mfenced close=")" open="("t,322ln mml:mfenced close=")" open="("t, and 622ln mml:mfenced close=")" open="("t when 0<alpha 12. This is due to the localization of extremal particles at the time of speed change, which depends on alpha and differs from the one in standard branching Brownian motion. We also establish in all cases the asymptotic law of the maximum and characterize the extremal process, which turns out to coincide essentially with that of standard branching Brownian motion.

J	Vogt, M; Schmid, M				Vogt, Michael; Schmid, Matthias			Clustering with statistical error control	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article; Early Access						k-means clustering; cluster analysis; multiple statistical testing; number of clusters; statistical error control	NUMBER; ORDER	This article presents a clustering approach that allows for rigorous statistical error control similar to a statistical test. We develop estimators for both the unknown number of clusters and the clusters themselves. The estimators depend on a tuning parameter alpha which is similar to the significance level of a statistical hypothesis test. By choosing alpha, one can control the probability of overestimating the true number of clusters, while the probability of underestimation is asymptotically negligible. In addition, the probability that the estimated clusters differ from the true ones is controlled. In the theoretical part of the article, formal versions of these statements on statistical error control are derived in a baseline model with convex clusters. A simulation study and two applications to temperature and gene expression microarray data complement the theoretical analysis.

Data Source/Study Setting Medicaid State Drug Utilization Database (SDUD) 2011-2018, comprising the universe of outpatient prescription medications covered under the Medicaid program. Study Design Differences-in-differences and event-study linear models compare population rates of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole) use in expansion and nonexpansion states, controlling for population characteristics, state, and time. Principal Findings Relative to nonexpansion states, Medicaid-financed hormonal therapy prescriptions increased by 27.2 per 100 000 nonelderly women in a state. This implies a 28.8 percent increase from the pre-expansion mean of 94.2 per 100 000 nonelderly women in expansion states. The event-study model reveals no evidence of differential pretrends in expansion and nonexpansion states and suggests use grew to 40 or more prescriptions per 100 000 nonelderly women 3-5 years postexpansion. Conclusions Medicaid expansion may have had a meaningful impact on the ability of lower-income women to access effective hormonal therapies used to treat breast cancer.

However, prolongation of gestation prevents morbidity and decreases complications of prematurity. The current investigation is to define risk factors for the adverse neurological outcome from the influence of PPROM of at least 7 days. Methods: A case-control study included three groups of preterm infants born at the University Hospitals Bonn and Essen, Germany. The first group consisted of infants with PPROM of at least 7 days and no chorioamnionitis (CA) (PPROM group), the second included preterm infants with CA (CA group), and the third group consisted of infants without PPROM and CA (control group). The outcome was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development at a corrected age of 24 months. Each group consisted of 20 corresponding infants with an identical birth weight and gestational age at birth. Results: There was no significant difference between the mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) scores (mean +/- SD): the MDI score was 101 +/- 14 in the PPROM group, 98 +/- 12 in the CA group and 96 +/- 17 in the control group; the PDI score 96 +/- 10, 89 +/- 16, and 90 +/- 17, respectively. Multiple regression analysis revealed no significant influence of PPROM and CA on neurological outcome. Conclusions: PPROM of at least 7 days has no influence on neurodevelopmental outcome at a corrected age of 24 months when birth is initiated in the case of beginning CA.

GRAVITY Collaboration	Detection of the Schwarzschild precession in the orbit of the star S2 near the Galactic centre massive black hole	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						black hole physics; Galaxy: nucleus; gravitation; relativistic processes	SGR A-ASTERISK; STELLAR ORBITS; GENERAL-RELATIVITY; YOUNG STARS; GALAXY; RESOLUTION; SINFONI; FIELD; MILKY; DYNAMICS	The star S2 orbiting the compact radio source Sgr A* is a precision probe of the gravitational field around the closest massive black hole (candidate). Over the last 2.7 decades we have monitored the star's radial velocity and motion on the sky, mainly with the SINFONI and NACO adaptive optics (AO) instruments on the ESO VLT, and since 2017, with the four-telescope interferometric beam combiner instrument GRAVITY. In this Letter we report the first detection of the General Relativity (GR) Schwarzschild Precession (SP) in S2's orbit. Owing to its highly elliptical orbit (e=0.88), S2's SP is mainly a kink between the pre-and post-pericentre directions of motion approximate to +/- 1 year around pericentre passage, relative to the corresponding Kepler orbit. The superb 2017-2019 astrometry of GRAVITY defines the pericentre passage and outgoing direction. The incoming direction is anchored by 118 NACO-AO measurements of S2's position in the infrared reference frame, with an additional 75 direct measurements of the S2-Sgr A* separation during bright states ("flares") of Sgr A*. Our 14-parameter model fits for the distance, central mass, the position and motion of the reference frame of the AO astrometry relative to the mass, the six parameters of the orbit, as well as a dimensionless parameter f(SP) for the SP (f(SP)=0 for Newton and 1 for GR). From data up to the end of 2019 we robustly detect the SP of S2, delta phi approximate to 12 ' per orbital period. From posterior fitting and MCMC Bayesian analysis with different weighting schemes and bootstrapping we find f(SP)=1.10 +/- 0.19. The S2 data are fully consistent with GR. Any extended mass inside S2's orbit cannot exceed approximate to 0.1% of the central mass. Any compact third mass inside the central arcsecond must be less than about 1000 M-circle dot.

In addition, multi-omics data increase the chance to robustly identify molecular patient sub-groups and hence open the door towards a better personalized treatment of diseases. Several methods have been proposed for unsupervised clustering of multi-omics data. However, a number of challenges remain, such as the magnitude of features and the large difference in dimensionality across different omics data sources. Results We propose a multi-modal sparse denoising autoencoder framework coupled with sparse non-negative matrix factorization to robustly cluster patients based on multi-omics data. The proposed model specifically leverages pathway information to effectively reduce the dimensionality of omics data into a pathway and patient specific score profile. In consequence, our method allows us to understand, which pathway is a feature of which particular patient cluster. Moreover, recently proposed machine learning techniques allow us to disentangle the specific impact of each individual omics feature on a pathway score. We applied our method to cluster patients in several cancer datasets using gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation and CNVs, demonstrating the possibility to obtain biologically plausible disease subtypes characterized by specific molecular features. Comparison against several competing methods showed a competitive clustering performance. In addition, post-hoc analysis of somatic mutations and clinical data provided supporting evidence and interpretation of the identified clusters. Conclusions Our suggested multi-modal sparse denoising autoencoder approach allows for an effective and interpretable integration of multi-omics data on pathway level while addressing the high dimensional character of omics data. Patient specific pathway score profiles derived from our model allow for a robust identification of disease subgroups.

We show that this structure survives to some extent for a random medium in the sense of quantitative stochastic homogenization: In three space dimensions, the effective dipole and quadrupole - but not the octupole - can be inferred without knowing the realization of the random medium far away from the (overall neutral) source and the point of interest. Mathematically, this is achieved by using the two-scale expansion to higher order to construct isomorphisms between the hetero- and homogeneous versions of spaces of harmonic functions that grow at a certain rate, or decay at a certain rate away from the singularity (near the origin); these isomorphisms crucially respect the natural pairing between growing and decaying harmonic functions given by the second Green's formula. This not only yields effective multipoles (the quotient of the spaces of decaying functions) but also intrinsic moments (taken with respect to the elements of the spaces of growing functions). The construction of these rigid isomorphisms relies on a good (and dimension-dependent) control on the higher-order correctors and their flux potentials.

Increased tooth mobility after fixed orthodontic appliance treatment can be selectively utilized for case refinement via positioner therapy - a pilot study	BMC ORAL HEALTH			English	Article						Case refinement; Orthodontic tooth movement; Positioner; Tooth mobility measurement	IN-VIVO DETERMINATION; INTRAORAL MEASUREMENT; DISPLACEMENT; DEVICE	BackgroundIncreased tooth mobility persists after fixed orthodontic appliance removal, which is therapeutically utilized for post-treatment finishing with positioners. As such a fine adjustment is only required for selected teeth, the aim of this pilot study was to investigate tooth mobility in vivo on corrected and uncorrected subgroups under positioner therapy.MethodsMobility was measured on upper teeth of 10 patients (mean age 16.8) by applying loadings for 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0s with a novel device directly after multibracket appliance debonding as much as 2d, 1, 2 and 6weeks later. Positioners were inserted at day 2. Specimens were divided into Group C (teeth corrected via positioner), Group N (uncorrected teeth adjacent to teeth from group C), and Group U (uncorrected teeth in an anchorage block). Untreated individuals served as controls (n =10, mean age 22.4). Statistics were performed via Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Welch's unequal variances t-test for comparisons between groups. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsAfter 1week, tooth mobility in Group U almost resembled controls (13.0-15.7N), and reached physiological values after 6weeks (17.4N vs. 17.3N in controls). Group C (9.0-13.4N) and Group N (9.2-14.7N) maintained increased mobility after 6weeks. Tooth mobility was generally higher by reason of long loading durations (10.0s).ConclusionsPositioner therapy can selectively utilized increased tooth mobility upon orthodontic fixed appliance treatment for case refinements. Here, uncorrected teeth in anchorage blocks are not entailed by unwanted side effects and recover after 6 weeks post treatment. Corrected teeth and their neighbors exhibit enhanced mobility even after 6weeks, which represents a necessity for the proper correction of tooth position, and concurrently arouses the requirement for an adequate retention protocol.

Since pre-industrial times, the globally averaged dry mole fraction of methane in the atmosphere has increased considerably. Emissions from coal mining are one of the primary anthropogenic methane sources. However, our knowledge about different sources and sinks of methane is still subject to great uncertainties. Comprehensive measurement campaigns and reliable chemistry-climate models, are required to fully understand the global methane budget and to further develop future climate mitigation strategies. The CoMet 1.0 campaign (May to June 2018) combined airborne in situ, as well as passive and active remote sensing measurements to quantify the emissions from coal mining in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB, Poland). Roughly 502 kt of methane is emitted from the ventilation shafts per year. In order to help with the flight planning during the campaigns, we performed 6 d forecasts using the online coupled, three-time nested global and regional chemistry-climate model MECO(n). We applied three-nested COSMO/MESSy instances going down to a spatial resolution of 2.8 km over the USCB. The nested global-regional model system allows for the separation of local emission contributions from fluctuations in the background methane. Here, we introduce the forecast set-up and assess the impact of the model's spatial resolution on the simulation of methane plumes from the ventilation shafts. Uncertainties in simulated methane mixing ratios are estimated by comparing different airborne measurements to the simulations. Results show that MECO(3) is able to simulate the observed methane plumes and the large-scale patterns (including vertically integrated values) reasonably well. Furthermore, we obtain reasonable forecast results up to forecast day four.

The use of these elements became necessary for several reasons: in the vicinity of the locks, which are over 100 years old, driving is not permitted, groundwater that attacks concrete (ammonium and sulphate) occurs in relevant proportions in the load transfer area and comparatively high loads of up to 2 & x2008;600 kN must be transferred. The jet grouted piles consist of a jet column with a diameter of 1.0 m and lengths up to 7.5 m, into which a steel tension member (diameter up to 14 cm) is inserted. As there is no general approval by the building authorities for such jet grouted piles, the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) granted approval in individual cases (ZiE) after extensive investigations and theoretical considerations. The jet grouted piles were chosen because the jet grouting of the subsoil creates an interlocking of the jet grout column with the subsoil due to different erosion resistances. Thus, using a cement with a low w/c-value of 0.6, a permanent load transfer is guaranteed, even if the concrete is attacked. The jet grouted piles are used at depths from 25 m below ground level (in the load-bearing sands). Comprehensive observations of the groundwater conditions and the nature of the groundwater were utilized to optimise the use of the jet grouted piles.

A comparative pharmaco-metabolomic study of glutaminase inhibitors in glioma stem-like cells confirms biological effectiveness but reveals differences in target-specificity	CELL DEATH DISCOVERY			English	Article							CANCER CELLS; GLIOBLASTOMA; PROLIFERATION; GROWTH; GLUTAMINOLYSIS; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSFORMATION; RESISTANCE	Cancer cells upregulate anabolic processes to maintain high rates of cellular turnover. Limiting the supply of macromolecular precursors by targeting enzymes involved in biosynthesis is a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Several tumors excessively metabolize glutamine to generate precursors for nonessential amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids, in a process called glutaminolysis. Here we show that pharmacological inhibition of glutaminase (GLS) eradicates glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), a small cell subpopulation in glioblastoma (GBM) responsible for therapy resistance and tumor recurrence. Treatment with small molecule inhibitors compound 968 and CB839 effectively diminished cell growth and in vitro clonogenicity of GSC neurosphere cultures. However, our pharmaco-metabolic studies revealed that only CB839 inhibited GLS enzymatic activity thereby limiting the influx of glutamine derivates into the TCA cycle. Nevertheless, the effects of both inhibitors were highly GLS specific, since treatment sensitivity markedly correlated with GLS protein expression. Strikingly, we found GLS overexpressed in in vitro GSC models as compared with neural stem cells (NSC). Moreover, our study demonstrates the usefulness of in vitro pharmaco-metabolomics to score target specificity of compounds thereby refining drug development and risk assessment.

Chemistry-guided screening with a software tool dedicated to identifying halogenated compounds in HPLC-MS data indicated the presence of several uncharacterised HNPs in an extract of the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua (Nag.) Gomont 108b. Three new natural products, tjipanazoles K, L, and M, were isolated from this strain together with the known tjipanazoles D and I. Taking into account the structures of all tjipanazole derivatives detected in this strain, reanalysis of the tjipanazole biosynthetic gene cluster allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for the tjipanazoles. As the isolated tjipanazoles show structural similarity to arcyriaflavin A, an inhibitor of the clinically relevant multidrug-transporter ABCG2 overexpressed by different cancer cell lines, the isolated compounds were tested for ABCG2 inhibitory activity. Only tjipanazole K showed appreciable transporter inhibition, whereas the compounds lacking the pyrrolo[3,4-c] ring or featuring additional chloro substituents were found to be much less active.

NA64 Collaboration	Improved limits on a hypothetical X(16.7) boson and a dark photon decaying into e(+)e(-) pairs	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							VECTOR GAUGE BOSON; PHI-MESON DECAYS; EXCLUSION LIMITS; HEAVY NEUTRINOS; SEARCH; PARTICLES; FORCES; PI(0); U(1)S	The improved results on a direct search for a new X(16.7 MeV) boson that could explain the anomalous excess of e(+)e(-) pairs observed in the decays of the excited Be-8* nuclei ("Berillium or X17 anomaly") are reported. Interestingly, new recent results in the nuclear transitions of another nucleus, He-4, seems to support this anomaly spurring the need for an independent measurement. If the X boson exists, it could be produced in the bremsstrahlung reaction e(-)Z -> e(-)ZX by a high energy beam of electrons incident on the active target in the NA64 experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron and observed through its subsequent decay into e(+)e(-) pairs. No evidence for such decays was found from the combined analysis of the data samples with total statistics corresponding to 8.4 x 10(10) electrons on target collected in 2017 and 2018. This allows one to set new limits on the X - e(-) coupling in the range 1.2 x 10(-4) less than or similar to epsilon(e) less than or similar to 6.8 x 10(-4), excluding part of the parameter space favored by the X17 anomaly, and setting new bounds on the mixing strength of photons with dark photons (A') with a mass less than or similar to 24 MeV. For the 2018 run, the setup was optimized to probe the region of parameter space characterized by a large coupling epsilon. This allowed a significant improvement in sensitivity despite a relatively modest increase in statistics.

Here, we investigated links between variability in organic matter availability from land and marine sources and infauna communities in two contrasting canyon systems off New Zealand and used stable isotope analyses to identify potential food sources of benthic invertebrates. Kaikoura Canyon, a steep, short canyon close to the shore, was characterized by high food availability and varying proportions of marine- and land-derived organic matter, whereas Hokitika Canyon, a narrow and lower-gradient canyon that extends further from the coast, was characterized by low food availability and mostly land-derived sediment organic matter throughout. Both macrofaunal and meiofaunal abundance and biomass were greater in Kaikoura Canyon than in Hokitika Canyon. Correlation analyses suggested that land-derived organic matter may contribute to increased meiofaunal abundance in Kaikoura Canyon. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses, however, did not provide unequivocal support for the uptake of land-derived material by large benthic invertebrates in Kaikoura Canyon. Infaunal abundance and biomass were low throughout Hokitika Canyon despite similar concentrations of land-derived organic matter in sediments of both canyons, which suggests that variations in marine-derived organic matter inputs is the main driver of community differences among canyons. Refractory vascular plant material by itself may not provide an adequate food supply to infaunal organisms, but may represent a complementary food resource when more labile marine phytodetritus is also readily available.

In neurons, the SUMOylation-dependent control of a subset of neuronal transcription factors is known to regulate various aspects of nerve cell differentiation, development, and function. In an unbiased screen for endogenous SUMOylation targets in the developing mouse brain, based on a His(6)-HA-SUMO1 knock-in mouse line, we previously identified the transcription factor Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 20 (Zbtb20) as a new SUMO1-conjugate. We show here that the three key SUMO paralogues SUMO1, SUMO2, and SUMO3 can all be conjugated to Zbtb20 in vitro in HEK293FT cells, and we confirm the SUMOylation of Zbtb20 in vivo in mouse brain. Using primary hippocampal neurons from wild-type and Zbtb20 knock-out (KO) mice as a model system, we then demonstrate that the expression of Zbtb20 is required for proper nerve cell development and neurite growth and branching. Furthermore, we show that the SUMOylation of Zbtb20 is essential for its function in this context, and provide evidence indicating that SUMOylation affects the Zbtb20-dependent transcriptional profile of neurons. Our data highlight the role of SUMOylation in the regulation of neuronal transcription factors that determine nerve cell development, and they demonstrate that key functions of the transcription factor Zbtb20 in neuronal development and neurite growth are under obligatory SUMOylation control.

European flint landraces are an untapped genetic resource for genes and alleles conferring cold tolerance which they acquired during their adaptation to the agroecological conditions in Europe.ResultsBased on a phenotyping experiment of 276 doubled haploid lines derived from the European flint landrace "Petkuser Ferdinand Rot" diverging for cold tolerance, we selected 21 of these lines for an RNA-seq experiment. The different genotypes showed highly variable transcriptomic responses to cold. We identified 148, 3254 and 563 genes differentially expressed with respect to cold treatment, cold tolerance and growth rate at cold, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment demonstrated that the detoxification of reactive oxygen species is associated with cold tolerance, whereas amino acids might play a crucial role as antioxidant precursors and signaling molecules.ConclusionDoubled haploids representing a European maize flint landrace display genotype-specific transcriptome patterns associated with cold response, cold tolerance and seedling growth rate at cold. Identification of cold regulated genes in European flint germplasm, could be a starting point for introgressing such alleles in modern breeding material for maize improvement.

Revisiting Union Wage and Job Loss Effects Using the Displaced Worker Surveys	ILR REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						union wage gaps; job loss; displaced workers	CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY; EMPLOYMENT	Estimates of union wage effects have been challenged by concerns regarding unobserved worker heterogeneity and endogenous job changes. Many economists believe that union wage premiums lead to business failures and other forms of worker displacement. In this article, the authors examine displacement rates and union wage gaps using the 1994-2018 biennial Displaced Worker Survey (DWS) supplements to the monthly Current Population Surveys. For more than two decades, displacement rates among union and non-union workers have been remarkably similar. The authors observe changes in earnings resulting from transitions between union and non-union jobs following exogenous job changes. Consistent with prior evidence from the 1994 and 1996 DWS, findings show longitudinal estimates of average union wage effects close to 15%, which are similar to standard cross-section estimates and suggestive of minimal ability bias. Wage losses moving from union to non-union jobs exceed gains from non-union to union transitions.

According to the World Health Organization classification, CLL is an indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Diagnosis requires an increase of B-lymphocytes to more than 5.0 & x202f;G/l as well as detection of CD5- and CD19-positive B-lymphocytes. Symptoms can be B symptoms, fatigue or frequent infections. Therapy is only required if there are pronounced symptoms or changes in the blood count, such as a relevant drop in hemoglobin and/or platelets. The prognosis strongly depends on the individual molecular and cytogenetic risk factors. For a long time, the first-line treatment was characterized by chemotherapy in combination with CD20 antibodies. In recent years, the approval of new targeted drugs has changed the treatment landscape significantly and has led to a shift towards chemotherapy-free regimens.

Due to the limited accuracy of radiologic imaging, there is an unacceptably high rate of postoperative adjuvant CRT. This tri-modality treatment doubles chronic therapy-related toxicity compared to CRT alone. Surgical staging prior to treatment can avoid under- and overtreatment. Materials and methods In a literature review of publications mainly focusing on potentially practice-changing data was performed. Results For optimal results, CRT must comprise percutaneous and brachytherapy with a biologically effective dose (EQD2Gy) of 80-85 & x202f;Gy to the tumor. Simultaneous chemotherapy consists of 5-6 weekly doses of cisplatin 40 & x202f;mg/body surface area (BSA). Treatment duration should not exceed 8 weeks (56 days), and has an influence on local control. Outcomes in experienced centers with at least 28 CRT/year are superior to those with smaller numbers of patients. There is no indication for routine hysterectomy after state-of-the-art chemoradiation. In contrast, patients with histologically confirmed residual tumor might benefit from salvage (rescue) hysterectomy. Conclusion Cisplatin-based CRT is standard of care treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. For the best possible oncologic results, external beam radiation plus brachytherapy plus simultaneous chemotherapy in an overall treatment time of <56 days is crucial. This therapy should be performed in high volume centers by an experienced, interdisciplinary team.

This organism is a highly potent degrader of intestinal mucins and the hydrolyzed glycan compounds can then serve as carbon sources for the organism itself or other members of the gut microbiota via cross-feeding. Despite its importance for the hosts' health and microbiota composition, exact mucin degrading mechanisms are still mostly undear. In this study, we identified and characterized three extracellular beta-galactosidases (Amuc_0771, Amuc_0824, and Amuc_1666) from A. muciniphila ATCC BAA-835. The substrate spectrum of all three enzymes was analyzed and the results indicated a preference for different galactosidic linkages for each hydrolase. All preferred target structures are prevalent within mucins of the colonic habitat of A. muciniphila. To check a potential function of the enzymes for the degradation of mucosal glycan structures, porcine stomach mucin was applied as a model substrate. In summary, we could confirm the involvement of all three beta-galactosidases from A. muciniphila in the complex mucin degradation machinery of this important gut microbe. These findings could contribute to the understanding of the molecular interactions between A. muciniphila and its host on a molecular level. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Green, JR; Jansen, K; Steffens, F				Green, Jeremy R.; Jansen, Karl; Steffens, Fernanda			Improvement, generalization, and scheme conversion of Wilson-line operators on the lattice in the auxiliary field approach	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							SHORT-DISTANCE PROPERTIES; NONPERTURBATIVE RENORMALIZATION; CONTINUUM-LIMIT; HEAVY-QUARK; LIGHT; QCD	Nonlocal quark bilinear operators connected by link paths are used for studying parton distribution functions (PDFs) and transverse momentum-dependent PDFs of hadrons using lattice QCD. The nonlocality makes it difficult to understand the renormalization and improvement of these operators using standard methods. In previous work, we showed that by introducing an auxiliary field on the lattice, one can understand an on-axis Wilson-line operator as the product of two local operators in an extended theory. In this paper, we provide details about the calculation in perturbation theory of the factor for conversion from our lattice-suitable renormalization scheme to the (MS) over bar scheme. Extending our work, we study Symanzik improvement of the extended theory to understand the pattern of discretization effects linear in the lattice spacing, a, which are present even if the lattice fermion action exactly preserves chiral symmetry. This provides a prospect for an eventual O(a) improvement of lattice calculations of PDFs. We also generalize our approach to apply to Wilson lines along lattice diagonals and to piecewise-straight link paths.

Risk of respiratory artefacts in functional connectivity-based real-time fMRI neurofeedback	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Physiological artefacts; Frontostriatal functional connectivity; fMRI neurofeedback; Large-scale networks; Global signal regression; Schizophrenia; TAPAS PhysIO toolbox	GLOBAL SIGNAL; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; EMPIRICAL ANALYSES; NULL-HYPOTHESIS; BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; NETWORKS; CORTEX; SCALE; ANTICORRELATIONS	Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI NFB) is a promising method for targeted regulation of pathological brain processes in mental disorders. But most NFB approaches so far have used relatively restricted regional activation as a target, which might not address the complexity of the underlying network changes. Aiming towards advancing novel treatment tools for disorders like schizophrenia, we developed a large-scale network functional connectivity-based rtfMRI NFB approach targeting dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex connectivity with the striatum. In a double-blind randomized yoke-controlled single-session feasibility study with N = 38 healthy controls, we identified strong associations between our connectivity estimates and physiological parameters reflecting the rate and regularity of breathing. These undesired artefacts are especially detrimental in rtfMRI NFB, where the same data serves as an online feedback signal and offline analysis target. To evaluate ways to control for the identified respiratory artefacts, we compared model-based physiological nuisance regression and global signal regression (GSR) and found that GSR was the most effective method in our data. Our results strongly emphasize the need to control for physiological artefacts in connectivity-based rtfMRI NFB approaches and suggest that GSR might be a useful method for online data correction for respiratory artefacts.

Previous studies have typically explained the emergence of altruistic punishment by recouping punishers with other public goods or altruistic behaviors, but introducing new public goods would then raise the n-order social dilemma. Costly signaling theory (CST), by viewing public goods as costly signaling, is a potential approach to explain the evolution of cooperation without introducing other public goods because partnering altruistic signalers is not necessarily an altruistic behavior. However, previous studies based on CST have rarely distinguished altruistic punishment as the distinctive costly signal from a nonpunishing contribution. In this study, we explore the rules of transforming payoffs into fitness by differentiating punishing costly signals from nonpunishing costly signals. The results show that, under the condition that the efficacy of costly signaling is incomplete, altruistic punishment can only emerge in the population with transforming rules in which individuals regard altruistic punishment as a distinctive costly signal rather than a nonpunishing contribution.

The correlations of charged particles have been measured in the range of laboratory pseudorapidity -1.5 < <eta> < 2.0 and transverse momentum 0.1 < p(T)< 5.0 GeV and event multiplicities N-ch up to six times larger than the average <left angle bracket>N-ch > approximate to 5. The two-particle correlations have been measured in terms of the angular observables c(n{2})=< < cosn Delta phi > >, where n is between 1 and 4 and phi is the relative azimuthal angle between the two particles. Comparisons with available models of deep inelastic scattering, which are tuned to reproduce inclusive particle production, suggest that the measured two-particle correlations are dominated by contributions from multijet production. The correlations observed here do not indicate the kind of collective behaviour recently observed at the highest RHIC and LHC energies in high-multiplicity hadronic collisions.

Methods Palliative care experts from 30 African countries were invited to participate in an online survey, conducted in English and French, that consisted of 58 questions on: socio-demographics, the activities, motivation and coordination of volunteers, and an appraisal of recent developments in volunteering. The questionnaire was pre-tested in Uganda. Quantitative data was analysed descriptively with SPSS v22; answers on open-ended questions were analysed using content analysis. Results Twenty-five respondents from 21 countries replied to the questionnaire. The typical volunteer was reported to be a female aged between 30 and 50 years. Volunteer roles included, among others: direct patient assistance, providing psychosocial / spiritual support, and assisting patients' families. Respondents considered altruism, civic engagement and personal gain (for a professional career) as volunteers' most significant motivational drivers. One in two respondents noted that recruiting volunteers is easy, and cooperation with the communities was often mentioned as helpful. Trainings mostly occurred before the first assignment, with topics covering the palliative care concept, care, psychosocial support and team work. Half of respondents described recent overall volunteering developments as positive, while the other half described problems primarily with financing and motivation. Most volunteers received transportation allowances or bicycles; some received monetary compensation. Conclusions The findings show a wide range of volunteering in palliative care. We identified volunteers as typically 30-50 years old, non-professional females, motivated by altruism, a sense of civic engagement and personal gain.

In particular, we propose that there is an infrared triality between certain triples of theories with orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. The proposal is supported by matching of anomalies and elliptic genera. This triality can be viewed as a (0, 1) counterpart of the (0, 2) triality proposed earlier by two of the authors and A. Gadde. We also describe the relation between global anomalies in gauge theoretic and sigma-model descriptions, filling in a gap in the present literature.

The focus of this work is set on the generation of proper thermodynamic ensembles at a quantum chemical level for conformers, but similar procedures for protonation states, tautomerism and non-covalent complex geometries are also discussed. The conformational ensembles consisting of all significantly populated minimum energy structures normally form the basis of further, mostly DFT computational work, such as the calculation of spectra or macroscopic properties. By using basic quantum chemical methods, electronic effects or possible bond breaking/formation are accounted for and a very reasonable initial energetic ranking of the candidate structures is obtained. Due to the huge computational speedup gained by the fast low-cost quantum chemical methods, overall short computation times even for systems with hundreds of atoms (typically drug-sized molecules) are achieved. Furthermore, specialized applications, such as sampling with implicit solvation models or constrained conformational sampling for transition-states, metal-, surface-, or noncovalently bound complexes are discussed, opening many possible applications in modern computational chemistry and drug discovery. The procedures have been implemented in a freely available computer code called CREST, that makes use of the fast and reliable GFNn-xTB methods.

The receptor harbors two distinct binding sites, uridine and di- and/or trinucleotides, but the RNases upstream of TLR8 remain poorly characterized. We identified two endolysosomal endoribonucleases, RNase T2 and RNase 2, that act synergistically to release uridine from oligoribonucleotides. RNase T2 cleaves preferentially before, and RNase 2 after, uridines. Live bacteria, P. falciparum-infected red blood cells, purified pathogen RNA, and synthetic oligoribonucleotides all required RNase 2 and T2 processing to activate TLR8. Uridine supplementation restored RNA recognition in RNASE2(-/-) or RNASET2(-/-) but not RNASE2(-/-) RNASET2(-/-) cells. Primary immune cells from RNase T2-hypomorphic patients lacked a response to bacterial RNA but responded robustly to small-molecule TLR8 ligands. Our data identify an essential function of RNase T2 and RNase 2 upstream of TLR8 and provide insight into TLR8 activation.

However, chronic activation of ILCs results in immune-mediated pathology. Here, we show that tissue-resident type 2 ILCs (ILC2s) display a distinct metabolic signature upon chronic activation. In the context of allergen-driven airway inflammation, ILC2s increase their uptake of both external lipids and glucose. Externally acquired fatty acids are transiently stored in lipid droplets and converted into phospholipids to promote the proliferation of ILC2s. This metabolic program is imprinted by interleukin-33 (IL-33) and regulated by the genes Pparg and Dgat1, which are both controlled by glucose availability and mTOR signaling. Restricting dietary glucose by feeding mice a ketogenic diet largely ablated ILC2-mediated airway inflammation by impairing fatty acid metabolism and the formation of lipid droplets. Together, these results reveal that pathogenic ILC2 responses require lipid metabolism and identify ketogenic diet as a potent intervention strategy to treat airway inflammation.

Water lily (Nymphaea thermarum) genome reveals variable genomic signatures of ancient vascular cambium losses	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						Nymphaea; vascular cambium; angiosperm evolution; genome; trait loss	CLASS IIIHD-ZIP; HD-ZIP; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; SECONDARY GROWTH; PLANT; PROTEIN; GENE; WOOD; COALESCENT; EXPRESSION	For more than 225 million y, all seed plants were woody trees, shrubs, or vines. Shortly after the origin of angiosperms similar to 140 million y ago (MYA), the Nymphaeales (water lilies) became one of the first lineages to deviate from their ancestral, woody habit by losing the vascular cambium, the meristematic population of cells that produces secondary xylem (wood) and phloem. Many of the genes and gene families that regulate differentiation of secondary tissues also regulate the differentiation of primary xylem and phloem, which are produced by apical meristems and retained in nearly all seed plants. Here, we sequenced and assembled a draft genome of the water lily Nymphaea thermarum, an emerging system for the study of early flowering plant evolution, and compared it to genomes from other cambium-bearing and cambium-less lineages (e.g., monocots and Nelumbo). This revealed lineage-specific patterns of gene loss and divergence. Nymphaea is characterized by a significant contraction of the HD-ZIP III transcription factors, specifically loss of REVOLUTA, which influences cambial activity in other angiosperms. We also found the Nymphaea and monocot copies of cambium-associated CLE signaling peptides display unique substitutions at otherwise highly conserved amino acids. Nelumbo displays no obvious divergence in cambium-associated genes. The divergent genomic signatures of convergent loss of vascular cambium reveals that even pleiotropic genes can exhibit unique divergence patterns in association with independent events of trait loss. Our results shed light on the evolution of herbaceousness-one of the key biological innovations associated with the earliest phases of angiosperm evolution.

An automated preloaded pipet tip SPE method for the accurate quantification of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from tea	ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Article							COFFEE BREW; RAPID-DETERMINATION; ROASTED COFFEE; CHROMATOGRAPHY; TOXICITY; FOOD	An automated polystyrene-divinyl benzene (PS-DVB) based standard preloaded-pipet tip-SPE method was developed for the prompt and precise quantification of contaminants in plant extracts using the example of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The objective of the technique was to establish a high-throughput SPE-automated workflow with minimized personal exposure to tremendously carcinogenic PAHs during standard and sample preparation. HPLC-FLD was used for the analysis of PAHs. LOD and LOQ for the investigated PAHs were found to be 16 ppb and 59 ppb, respectively. The recoveries were between 90-102% (RSD < 8%) for the standard compounds in the pure solvent, and between 90-95% (RSD < 10%) for spiked black tea extracts. A contaminated Primulae flos extract was also subjected to the preloaded PhyTip (R)-SPE scheme and revealed 70.8 mg kg(-1) chrysene and 60.9 mg kg(-1) benzo(a) anthracene. In order to enhance method reproducibility and to increase the sample throughput, a PhyNexus (R) (San Jose, CA), MEA T Robotic Purification System was used for the automation of the SPE method. The automated method with a duration of 17 minutes for 12 samples revealed high recoveries and reproducibility for the PAH standards (90-103% with RSD < 8%) and between 90-95% (RSD < 10%) for spiked black tea extracts. The presented analytical scheme provides an excellent tool for rapid and precise determination of PAHs from complex mixtures.

Sequelae of Premature Birth in Young Adults Incidental Findings on Routine Brain MRI	CLINICAL NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Preterm birth; Diagnostic imaging; White matter diseases; Neuroradiology; Lateral ventricles	WHITE-MATTER; PRETERM BIRTH; VENTRICULAR DILATATION; BORN; INFANTS; INJURY; MATURATION; MORTALITY; AGE	Background and Purpose Qualitative studies about the abnormalities appreciated on routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences in prematurely born adults are lacking. This article aimed at filling this knowledge gap by (1) qualitatively describing routine imaging findings in prematurely born adults, (2) evaluating measures for routine image interpretation and (3) investigating the impact of perinatal variables related to premature birth. Methods In this study two board-certified radiologists assessed T1-weighted and FLAIR-weighted images of 100 prematurely born adults born very preterm (VP <32 weeks) and/or at very low birth weight (VLBW <1500 & x202f;g) and 106 controls born at full term (FT) (mean age 26.8 & x202f;+/- 0.7 years). The number of white matter lesions (WML) was counted according to localization. Lateral ventricle volume (LVV) was evaluated subjectively and by measurements of Evans' index (EI) and frontal-occipital-horn ratio (FOHR). Freesurfer-based volumetry served as reference standard. Miscellaneous incidental findings were noted as free text. Results The LVV was increased in 24.7% of VP/VLBW individuals and significantly larger than in FT controls. This was best identified by measurement of FOHR (AUC & x202f;= 0.928). Ventricular enlargement was predicted by low gestational age (odds ratio: 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.98) and presence of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage (odds ratio: 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.92). The numbers of deep and periventricular WML were increased while subcortical WMLs were not. Conclusion Enlargement of the LVV and deep and periventricular WMLs are typical sequelae of premature birth that can be appreciated on routine brain MRI. To increase sensitivity of abnormal LVV detection, measurement of FOHR seems feasible in clinical practice.

RECHTSMEDIZIN			German	Article; Early Access						Clostridium septicum; Sepsis; Skin lesion; Complications; Endogenous and exogenous infection	CLOSTRIDIUM-SEPTICUM	A 77-year-old woman had been treated with injection therapy by the emergency medical service due to acute pain in her back and thigh. Subsequently, she felt increasingly worse and fell when trying to stand up. After the arrival of the rescue service the woman needed resuscitation measures and eventually died. The emergency service noticed a discoloration and increasing swelling in the right hip and thigh region. During the forensic autopsy, which was carried out in a timely manner, no concrete findings were found which would have explained the sudden death but it was noticeable that the corpse already showed clear signs of putrefaction as well as an unusual gas interspersion. This gave the impression of a sepsis with gas-forming pathogens. Subsequently, microbiological tests were commissioned. Here Clostridium septicum could be detected.

Bank Quality, Judicial Efficiency, and Loan Repayment Delays in Italy	JOURNAL OF FINANCE			English	Article; Early Access							BANKRUPTCY REFORM; ENFORCEMENT; DETERMINANTS; INVESTMENT; OWNERSHIP; CONTRACTS; DEFAULTS; COSTS; RISK; FIRM	Italian firms delay payment to banks weakened by past loan losses. Exploiting Credit Register data, we fully absorb borrower fundamentals with firm-quarter effects. Identification therefore reflects firm choices to delay payment to some banks, depending on their health. This selective delay occurs more where legal enforcement of collateral recovery is slow. Poor enforcement encourages borrowers not to pay when the value of their bank relationship comes into doubt. Selective delays occur even by firms able to pay all lenders. Credit losses in Italy have thus been worsened by the combination of weak banks and weak legal enforcement.

An imaging line survey of OMC-1 to OMC-3: Averaged spectra of template regions	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules; ISM: individual objects: Orion A; submillimeter: ISM; methods: observational	MOLECULAR CLOUD; ORION; SUBMILLIMETER; CHEMISTRY; TRACERS; CORES	Context. Recently, sensitive wide-bandwidth receivers in the millimetre regime have enabled us to combine large spatial and spectral coverage for observations of molecular clouds. The resulting capability to map the distributions of lines from many molecules simultaneously yields unbiased coverage of the various environments within star-forming regions.Aims. Our aim is to identify the dominant molecular cooling lines and characteristic emission features in the 1.3 mm window of distinct regions in the northern part of the Orion A molecular cloud. By defining and analysing template regions, we also intend to help with the interpretation of observations from more distant sources which cannot be easily spatially resolved.Methods. We analyse an imaging line survey covering the area of OMC-1 to OMC-3 from 200.2 to 281.8 GHz obtained with the PI230 receiver at the APEX telescope. Masks are used to define regions with distinct properties (e.g. column density or temperature ranges) from which we obtain averaged spectra. Lines of 29 molecular species (55 isotopologues) are fitted for each region to obtain the respective total intensity.Results. We find that strong sources like Orion KL have a clear impact on the emission on larger scales. Although not spatially extended, their line emission contributes substantially to spectra averaged over large regions. Conversely, the emission signatures of dense, cold regions like OMC-2 and OMC-3 (e.g. enhanced N2H+ emission and low HCN/HNC ratio) seem to be difficult to pick up on larger scales, where they are eclipsed by signatures of stronger sources. In all regions, HCO+ appears to contribute between 3 and 6% to the total intensity, the most stable value for all bright species. N2H+ shows the strongest correlation with column density, but not with typical high-density tracers like HCN, HCO+, H2CO, or HNC. Common line ratios associated with UV illumination, CN/HNC and CN/HCO+, show ambiguous results on larger scales, suggesting that the identification of UV illuminated material may be more challenging. The HCN/HNC ratio may be related to temperature over varying scales.	[Brinkmann, N.; Wyrowski, F.; Colombo, D.; Menten, K. M.; Tang, X.

Exploring molecular complexity with ALMA (EMoCA): complex isocyanides in Sgr B2(N)	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						astrochemistry; line: identification; molecular data; radio lines: ISM; ISM: individual objects: Sagittarius B2(N); ISM: molecules	SUBMILLIMETER-WAVE SPECTRUM; ROTATIONAL SPECTRA; ETHYL ISOCYANIDE; VINYL CYANIDE; DISSOCIATIVE RECOMBINATION; MICROWAVE-SPECTRUM; METHYL CYANIDE; N-PROPYL; SPECTROSCOPY; MILLIMETER	Context. The Exploring Molecule Complexity with ALMA (EMoCA) survey is an imaging spectral line survey using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to study the hot-core complex Sagittarius B2(N). Recently, EMoCA revealed the presence of three new hot cores in this complex (N3-N5), in addition to providing detailed spectral data on the previously known hot cores in the complex (N1 and N2). The present study focuses on N2, which is a rich and interesting source for the study of complex molecules whose narrow line widths ameliorate the line confusion problem.Aims. We investigate the column densities and excitation temperatures of cyanide and isocyanide species in Sgr B2(N2). We then use state-of-the-art chemical models to interpret these observed quantities. We also investigate the effect of varying the cosmic-ray ionization rate (zeta) on the chemistry of these molecules.Methods. We used the EMoCA survey data to search for isocyanides in Sgr B2(N2) and their corresponding cyanide analogs. We then used the coupled three-phase chemical kinetics code MAGICKAL to simulate their chemistry. Several new species, and over 100 new reactions have been added to the network. In addition, a new single-stage simultaneous collapse/warm-up model has been implemented, thus eliminating the need for the previous two-stage models. A variable, visual extinction-dependent zeta was also incorporated into the model and tested.Results. We report the tentative detection of CH3NC and HCCNC in Sgr B2(N2), which represents the first detection of both species in a hot core of Sgr B2. In addition, we calculate new upper limits for C2H5NC, C2H3NC, HNC3, and HC3NH+. Our updated chemical models can reproduce most observed NC:CN ratios reasonably well depending on the physical parameters chosen. The model that performs best has an extinction-dependent cosmic-ray ionization rate that varies from 2 x 10(-15) s(-1) at the edge of the cloud to 1 x 10(-16) s(-1) in the center. Models with higher extinction-dependent zeta than this model generally do not agree as well, nor do models with a constant zeta greater than the canonical value of 1.3 x 10(-17) s(-1) throughout the source. Radiative transfer models are run using results of the best-fit chemical model. Column densities produced by the radiative transfer models are significantly lower than those determined observationally. Inaccuracy in the observationally determined density and temperature profiles is a possible explanation. Excitation temperatures are well reproduced for the true "hot core" molecules, but are more variable for other molecules such as HC3N, for which fewer lines exist in ALMA Band 3.Conclusions. The updated chemical models do a very good job of reproducing the observed abundances ratio of CH3NC:CH3CN towards Sgr B2(N2), while being consistent with upper limits for other isocyanide/cyanide pairs. HCCNC:HC3N is poorly reproduced, however. Our results highlight the need for models with A(V)-depdendent zeta. However, there is still much to be understood about the chemistry of these species, as evidenced by the systematic overproduction of HCCNC. Further study is also needed to understand the complex effect of varying zeta on the chemistry of these species. The new single-stage chemical model should be a powerful tool in analyzing hot-core sources in the future.	[Willis, E. R.; Garrod, R. T.; Barger, C.

Interaction of fat and aqueous phase parameters during high-hydrostatic pressure inactivation of Lactobacillus plantarum in oil-in-water emulsions	EUROPEAN FOOD RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						HHP; HPP; High hydrostatic pressure processing; Fat; Oil; Emulsion; Lactobacillus plantarum; pH; Protein; Surface hydrophobicity; Sucrose; Food spoilage	LACTIC-ACID BACTERIA; LISTERIA-MONOCYTOGENES; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SPOILAGE; STRAINS; RESISTANCE; MICROBIOLOGY; INJURY; HEAT; MILK	High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing of food can inactivate spoilage microorganisms, while largely preserving quality characteristics like color, flavor, texture, and vitamin content. However, the composition of the food matrix can strongly affect HHP inactivation efficiency. As systematic data on the interplay of different food matrix components are rare, we used defined oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions as a model system to investigate the impact of fat on the effect of the aqueous phase parameters sodium chloride (NaCl), sucrose, pH, and proteins on HHP inactivation of Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum strains. To identify a potential interconnection with cell surface characteristics, strains with hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics were considered. HHP inactivation varied widely among the investigated strains. In general, high NaCl and sucrose concentrations exerted a baroprotective effect, whereas low-pH environments enhanced inactivation, and the impact of proteins followed no clear trend. The presence of fat did not generally influence any of the aqueous phase parameters in its impact on HHP inactivation, but caused sporadic matrix and strain specific; however, cell surface hydrophobicity-independent alterations in inactivation efficiency. Still, fat was able to significantly change, and sometimes even invert, the effect of other food matrix parameters.	[Reitermayer, D.; Kafka, T. A.; Lenz, C. A.; Vogel, R.

Methods The European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) intends to provide expert help free of charge by a newly founded ECMM Expert Consultation Service for medical centres around the globe seeking advice when there is no fungal infection consultant available. The expert consult will provide recommendations and broad expertise on difficult-to-treat invasive fungal infections (eg azole-resistant Aspergillus species, Candida auris, mucormycosis) to improve diagnostic and therapeutic management and outcome. Results The initiative plans global outreach through video conferencing between ECMM Excellence Centers and treating physicians. FungiScope(R) registries will be used to structure case information and to evaluate the impact of the collegial advice system at regular intervals. Advice will follow recent guidelines, and EQUAL Scores will be used to measure guideline adherence. Conclusions Infectious diseases expert consultation should be an integral component of care for patients with difficult-to-treat invasive fungal infections.

Immunization of Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice with Freund's adjuvant inhibits the development of atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an IL7-like cytokine with essential impact on type 2 immune responses (Th2). Thymic stromal lymphopoietin is strongly expressed in epithelial cells of the skin, but also in various immune cells following appropriate stimulation. In this study, we investigated whether TSLP may be crucial for the anti-atherogenic effect of Freund's adjuvant. Subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) rapidly led to the expression of TSLP and IL1 beta at the site of injection. In male mice, CFA-induced TSLP occurred in immigrated monocytes-and not epithelial cells-and was dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL1 beta-signalling. In females, CFA-induced TSLP was independent of IL1 beta and upon ovariectomy. CFA/OVA led to a more pronounced imbalance of the T cell response in TSLPR-/- mice, with increased INF gamma/IL4 ratio compared with wild-type controls. To test whether TSLP contributes to the anti-atherogenic effects of Freund's adjuvant, we treated ApoE(-/-) and ApoE(-/-)/TSLPR-/- mice with either CFA/IFA or PBS. ApoE(-/-) mice showed less atherogenesis upon CFA/IFA compared with PBS injections. ApoE(-/-)/TSLPR-/- mice had no attenuation of atherogenesis upon CFA/IFA treatment. Freund's adjuvant executes significant immune-modulating effects via TSLP induction. TSLP-TSLPR signalling is critical for CFA/IFA-mediated attenuation of atherosclerosis.

Vyxeos was designated as an orphan medicinal product on January 11, 2012. The applicant for this medicinal product was Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited. Vyxeos is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine, antineoplastic agents that inhibit topoisomerase II activity and also cause DNA damage. The strength of Vyxeos is 5 units/mL, where 1 unit equals 1.0 mg cytarabine plus 0.44 mg daunorubicin. The marketing authorization holder Jazz Pharmaceuticals had found that this was an optimal ratio for the efficacy of the product. Study CLTR0310-301, a phase III, multicenter, randomized, trial of Vyxeos (daunorubicin-cytarabine) liposome injection versus standard 3+7 daunorubicin and cytarabine in patients aged 60-75 years with untreated high-risk (secondary) AML, showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups in overall survival (OS) with a median OS of 9.56 months in the daunorubicin-cytarabine arm compared with 5.95 months for standard chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.90; one-sided p = .003). The most common side effects were hypersensitivity including rash, febrile neutropenia, edema, diarrhea/colitis, mucositis, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, cough, headache, chills, arrhythmia, pyrexia, sleep disorders, and hypotension. Implications for Practice Vyxeos has demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in overall survival compared with the standard of care 7+3 in the proposed population of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes and therapy-related AML. This is remarkable given the very poor prognosis of these patients and their unmet medical need. Secondary endpoints support the primary outcome, in particular an increased rate of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is potentially the only curative treatment in AML.

Parts of the terpenoids stored in needles can be emitted together with de novo synthesized terpenoids. Since previous studies provided hints on xylem transported terpenoids as a third emission source, we tested if terpenoids are transported in xylem sap of Norway spruce. We further aimed at understanding if they might contribute to terpenoid emission from needles. We determined terpenoid content and composition in xylem sap, needles, bark, wood and roots of field grown trees, as well as terpenoid emissions from needles. We found considerable amounts of terpenoids-mainly oxygenated compounds-in xylem sap. The terpenoid concentration in xylem sap was relatively low compared with the content in other tissues, where terpenoids are stored in resin ducts. Importantly, the terpenoid composition in the xylem sap greatly differed from the composition in wood, bark or roots, suggesting that an internal transport of terpenoids takes place at the sites of xylem loading. Four terpenoids were identified in xylem sap and emissions, but not within needle tissue, suggesting that these compounds are likely derived from xylem sap. Our work gives hints that plant internal transport of terpenoids exists within conifers; studies on their functions should be a focus of future research.

As the innermost part of the Belle II detector, the pixel detector (PXD), based on DEPFET (DEpleted P-channel Field Effect Transistor) technology, is most exposed to radiation from the accelerator. An irradiation campaign was performed to verify that the PXD can cope with the expected amount of radiation. We present the results of this measurement campaign in which an X-ray machine was used to irradiate a single PXD half-ladder to a total dose of 266 kGy. The half-ladder is from the same batch as the half-ladders used for Belle II. According to simulations, the total accumulated dose corresponds to 7-10 years of Belle II operation. While individual components have been irradiated before, this campaign is the first full system irradiation. We discuss the effects on the DEPFET sensors, as well as the performance of the front-end electronics. In addition, we present efficiency studies of the half-ladder from beam tests performed before and after the irradiation.

Drebrin Autoantibodies in Patients with Seizures and Suspected Encephalitis	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							PROTEINS; ANTIBODIES; SEGMENTATION; DISEASE; CORTEX; CELLS; CNS	Objective Assess occurrence of the dendritic spine scaffolding protein Drebrin as a pathophysiologically relevant autoantibody target in patients with recurrent seizures and suspected encephalitis as leading symptoms. Methods Sera of 4 patients with adult onset epilepsy and suspected encephalitis of unresolved etiology and equivalent results in autoantibody screening were subjected to epitope identification. We combined a wide array of approaches, ranging from immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, subcellular binding pattern analyses in primary neuronal cultures, and immunohistochemistry in brains of wild-type and Drebrin knockout mice to in vitro analyses of impaired synapse formation, morphology, and aberrant neuronal excitability by antibody exposure. Results In the serum of a patient with adult onset epilepsy and suspected encephalitis, a strong signal at similar to 70kDa was detected by immunoblotting, for which mass spectrometry revealed Drebrin as the putative antigen. Three other patients whose sera also showed strong immunoreactivity around 70kDa on Western blotting were also anti-Drebrin-positive. Seizures, memory impairment, and increased protein content in cerebrospinal fluid occurred in anti-Drebrin-seropositive patients. Alterations in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging comprised amygdalohippocampal T2-signal increase and hippocampal sclerosis. Diagnostic biopsy revealed T-lymphocytic encephalitis in an anti-Drebrin-seropositive patient. Exposure of primary hippocampal neurons to anti-Drebrin autoantibodies resulted in aberrant synapse composition and Drebrin distribution as well as increased spike rates and the emergence of burst discharges reflecting network hyperexcitability. Interpretation Anti-Drebrin autoantibodies define a chronic syndrome of recurrent seizures and neuropsychiatric impairment as well as inflammation of limbic and occasionally cortical structures. Immunosuppressant therapies should be considered in this disorder.

Their origin as well as their number density across cosmic time are still under scrutiny, especially because of the paucity of spectroscopically confirmed samples. We have started a systematic census of UCMG candidates within the ESO Kilo Degree Survey, together with a large spectroscopic follow-up campaign to build the largest possible sample of confirmed UCMGs. This is the third paper of the series and the second based on the spectroscopic follow-up program. Here, we present photometrical and structural parameters of 33 new candidates at redshifts 0.15. z. 0.5 and confirm 19 of them as UCMGs, based on their nominal spectroscopically inferred M. and Re. This corresponds to a success rate of 58%, nicely consistent with our previous findings. The addition of these 19 newly confirmed objects allows us to fully assess the systematics on the system selection-and to finally reduce the number density uncertainties. Moreover, putting together the results from our current and past observational campaigns and some literature data, we build the largest sample of UCMGs ever collected, comprising 92 spectroscopically confirmed objects at 0.1. z. 0.5. This number raises to 116, allowing for a 3s tolerance on the M. and Re thresholds for the UCMG definition. For all these galaxies, we have estimated the velocity dispersion values at the effective radii, which have been used to derive a preliminary mass-velocity dispersion correlation.

CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article; Early Access						Climate change; Migration; Ecosystem services; Sea level rise; Drought; Pacific	ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; COUNTRIES	As one of the lowest-lying island nation states in the world, the Republic of the Marshall Islands is vulnerable to sea level rise, flooding and the associated impacts on soil and water salinity. Persistent drought is further affecting agricultural production and access to drinking water, and heat stress is increasingly common. The number of Marshallese people residing in the USA has increased rapidly from 6650 in 2000 to an estimated 30,000 in 2018. While we know that climate change is already affecting the Marshall Islands and that there are significant migration flows, we do not know to what extent people already migrate because of climate change. This paper addresses this gap and presents findings from interdisciplinary fieldwork in the Marshall Islands and destination areas in the USA. The research team conducted a survey (N = 278), focus group discussions, expert interviews and a geo-spatial analysis of flood extent and migration rates to study the relationship between climatic events, ecosystem services and migration. The results show that respondents primarily cite education, health care, work and family visits as migration drivers, and only few mention climate impacts or environmental change. However, respondents do identify impacts of climate change on their livelihoods, health and safety, and the study finds significant correlations between climate impacts, trends in ecosystem services and migration propensities at household level. Furthermore, 62% of Marshallese respondents in the USA indicated that climate change affects their decision to return to Marshall Islands in the future.

ATLAS Collaboration	Evidence for electroweak production of two jets in association with a Z gamma pair in pp collisions at root S=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article							PROTON-PROTON COLLISIONS; CROSS-SECTION; CONSTRAINTS; COUPLINGS; BOSON	Evidence for electroweak production of two jets in association with a Z gamma pair in root s = 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider is presented. The analysis uses data collected by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016 that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1). Events that contain a Z boson candidate decaying leptonically into either e(+)e(-) or mu(+)mu(-), a photon, and two jets are selected. The electroweak component is measured with observed and expected significances of 4.1 standard deviations. The fiducial cross-section for electroweak production is measured to be sigma(Z gamma jj-Ew) = 7.8 +/- 2.0 fb, in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

The data are compared to predictions from the SAID, MAID, JuBo, and BnGa partial-wave analyses. A refit within the BnGa approach including further data yields precise branching ratios for the N eta decay of nucleon resonances. A N eta-branching ratio of 0.33 +/- 0.04 for N(1650)1/2(-) is found, which reduces the large and controversially discussed N eta-branching ratio difference of the two lowest mass J(P) = 1/2(-) -resonances significantly.

Differential investment in pre- and post-mating male sexual traits in response to prolonged exposure to ambient UVB radiation in a fish	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ultraviolet light; Breeding coloration; Sperm traits; Sexual selection; Stickleback; Climate change	ULTRAVIOLET-B RADIATION; STICKLEBACK GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; 3-SPINED STICKLEBACK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INFORMATION-CONTENT; SPERM COMPETITION; EXTREME-WEATHER; ATLANTIC SALMON; RUTILUS-RUTILUS	Increasing UVB radiation (UVB) reaching earth's surface following stratospheric ozone depletion is linked to serious consequences for organisms. While studies have focused on direct cytocidal and immunomodulatory effects of UVB, indirect consequences for fitness-related life-history traits are largely unexplored, although knowledge is needed to understand organismal responses to climate change. The present study investigates the effects of developmental exposure to enhanced, but ecologically relevant, ambient UVB levels on growth (body size), parental behavior (nest-building), fitness -enhancing traits of pre-mating (sexual ornamentation) and post-mating (sperm traits) sexual selection as well as their interrelationships in male three-spinal sticklebacks (Gasterosteus actileatus). Moreover, potentially underlying direct UVB effects, testicular antioxidant capacity (TAC) and testes and skin melanization were quantified. Juvenile full-siblings were split into two groups and raised until adulthood in a semi-natural set-up under light conditions including either natural (UVBnormal) or elevated UVB levels (UVBenhanced). When becoming reproductive, males were kept individually before data collection took place at their reproductive peak. The results showed that males from the UVBenhanced-group were smaller than their brothers from the UVB,0,,,i-treatment, whereas no treatment differences were observed for sexual ornamentation, sperm traits and TAC. Moreover, UVB-stressed males built their nests faster and the relationship between body size and nest size was negative for UVBenhanced-males while being positive for UVBnormal-[males. These results demonstrate that, depending on physical state, UVB-stressed males adjusted their behavior to some extent. Additionally, a trade-off between the investment in pre- and post-mating traits was found for UVBenhanced-males, i.e. the intensity of their breeding coloration was negatively correlated with sperm number whereas this relationship was reversed for UVBnormal-males, thus showing an interaction between pre- and post-mating traits regarding exposure treatment. The interaction provides first experimental evidence that differential allocation to energetically demanding pre- and post-mating components of male fitness is triggered by a key environmental stressor of climate change.

As a result, the overall survival of patients can be extended by approximately 1.5 years. The taxane docetaxel, the CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone and the second generation antiandrogen apalutamide can currently be used as a combination partner for classic androgen deprivation. While the de novo synthesis of testosterone is the rationale for abiraterone or apalutamide combination, taxanes offer a promising approach in the presence of primarily androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. Due to the increased rate of side effects caused by combination therapy, it is important to clarify in daily clinical practice which patient group benefits in particular from the respective combination therapy. Hereby, the metastatic pattern, general condition and age play an important role. While there is good evidence of the use of docetaxel or abiraterone in visceral metastasis, apalutamide offers a very wide range of uses. Ultimately, the recommendation for combination therapy is always an individual decision that needs to be discussed with the patient, considering the benefits and risks.

Probing cosmic isotropy with a new X-ray galaxy cluster sample through the L-X-T scaling relation	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						cosmology; observations; X-rays; galaxies; clusters; large-scale structure of Universe; galaxies; clusters; general; methods; statistical; catalogs	PECULIAR VELOCITIES; DIPOLE ANISOTROPY; HIGH-REDSHIFT; H-I; LUMINOSITY; EVOLUTION; UNIVERSE; ABSORPTION; SUPERNOVAE; SPECTRUM	The isotropy of the late Universe and consequently of the X-ray galaxy cluster scaling relations is an assumption greatly used in astronomy. However, within the last decade, many studies have reported deviations from isotropy when using various cosmological probes; a definitive conclusion has yet to be made. New, effective and independent methods to robustly test the cosmic isotropy are of crucial importance. In this work, we use such a method. Specifically, we investigate the directional behavior of the X-ray luminosity-temperature (L-X-T) relation of galaxy clusters. A tight correlation is known to exist between the luminosity and temperature of the X-ray-emitting intracluster medium of galaxy clusters. While the measured luminosity depends on the underlying cosmology through the luminosity distance D-L, the temperature can be determined without any cosmological assumptions. By exploiting this property and the homogeneous sky coverage of X-ray galaxy cluster samples, one can effectively test the isotropy of cosmological parameters over the full extragalactic sky, which is perfectly mirrored in the behavior of the normalization A of the L-X-T relation. To do so, we used 313 homogeneously selected X-ray galaxy clusters from the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of galaxies. We thoroughly performed additional cleaning in the measured parameters and obtain core-excised temperature measurements for all of the 313 clusters. The behavior of the L-X-T relation heavily depends on the direction of the sky, which is consistent with previous studies. Strong anisotropies are detected at a greater than or similar to 4 sigma confidence level toward the Galactic coordinates (l,& x2006;b) similar to (280 degrees, - 20 degrees), which is roughly consistent with the results of other probes, such as Supernovae Ia. Several effects that could potentially explain these strong anisotropies were examined. Such effects are, for example, the X-ray absorption treatment, the effect of galaxy groups and low redshift clusters, core metallicities, and apparent correlations with other cluster properties, but none is able to explain the obtained results. Analyzing 10(5) bootstrap realizations confirms the large statistical significance of the anisotropic behavior of this sky region. Interestingly, the two cluster samples previously used in the literature for this test appear to have a similar behavior throughout the sky, while being fully independent of each other and of our sample. Combining all three samples results in 842 different galaxy clusters with luminosity and temperature measurements. Performing a joint analysis, the final anisotropy is further intensified (similar to 5 sigma), toward (l,& x2006;b) similar to (303 degrees, - 27 degrees), which is in very good agreement with other cosmological probes. The maximum variation of D-L seems to be similar to 16 +/- 3% for different regions in the sky. This result demonstrates that X-ray studies that assume perfect isotropy in the properties of galaxy clusters and their scaling relations can produce strongly biased results whether the underlying reason is cosmological or related to X-rays. The identification of the exact nature of these anisotropies is therefore crucial for any statistical cluster physics or cosmology study.	[Migkas, K.; Reiprich, T. H.; Pacaud, F.; Ramos-Ceja, M.

Collimated synchrotron threads linking the radio lobes of ESO 137-006	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						radio continuum: galaxies	HEAD-TAIL; GALAXIES; JET; CLUSTERS	We present MeerKAT 1000 MHz and 1400 MHz observations of a bright radio galaxy in the southern hemisphere, ESO 137-006. The galaxy lies at the centre of the massive and merging Norma galaxy cluster. The MeerKAT continuum images (rms similar to 0.02 mJy beam(-1) at similar to 10 '' resolution) reveal new features that have never been seen in a radio galaxy before: collimated synchrotron threads of yet unknown origin, which link the extended and bent radio lobes of ESO 137-006. The most prominent of these threads stretches in projection for about 80 kpc and is about 1 kpc in width. The radio spectrum of the threads is steep, with a spectral index of up to alpha similar or equal to 2 between 1000 and 1400 MHz.	[Ramatsoku, M.; Makhathini, S.; Smirnov, O.; Andati, L. A.

Many biological processes are based on interfacial protein action, ranging from cellular communication to immune responses and the protein-driven mineralization of bone. Despite the importance of interfacial proteins, comparatively little is known about their structure. The standard methods for studying crystalline or solution-phase proteins (X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy) are not well-suited for studying proteins at interfaces, and for these proteins we still lack a corresponding technique that can provide the same level of structural resolution. This is not surprising in view of the challenges involved in probing the structure of proteins within monomolecular films assembled at a very thin interface in situ. Vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy has the potential to overcome this challenge and investigate the structure and dynamics of proteins at interfaces at the molecular level with subpicosecond time resolution. While SFG studies were initially limited to simple model peptides, the past decade has seen a dramatic advancement of experimental techniques and data analysis methods that has made it possible to also study interfacial proteins and their folding, binding, orientation, hydration, and dynamics. In this review, we first explain the principles of SFG spectroscopy and the experimental and theoretical methods to measure and analyze protein SFG spectra. Then we give an extensive overview of the interfacial proteins studied to date with SFG. We highlight representative examples to demonstrate recent advances in probing the structure of proteins at the interfaces of liquids, membranes, minerals, and synthetic materials.

Physiological Basis of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss in a Tympanal Ear	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory neurons; auditory receptors; auditory transduction; hearing; mechanotransduction ion channel; noise-induced hearing loss	SPONTANEOUS OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS; LOCUST AUDITORY RECEPTORS; IMPULSE NOISE; ENDOCOCHLEAR POTENTIALS; EXPOSURE; CHANNELS; DAMAGE; CELLS; DEGENERATION; THRESHOLDS	Acoustic overexposure, such as listening to loud music too often, results in noise-induced hearing loss. The pathologies of this prevalent sensory disorder begin within the ear at synapses of the primary auditory receptors, their postsynaptic partners and their supporting cells. The extent of noise-induced damage, however, is determined by overstimulation of primary auditory receptors, upstream of where the pathologies manifest. A systematic characterization of the electrophysiological function of the upstream primary auditory receptors is warranted to understand how noise exposure impacts on downstream targets, where the pathologies of hearing loss begin. Here, we used the experimentally-accessible locust ear (male, Schistocerca gregaria) to characterize a decrease in the auditory receptor's ability to respond to sound after noise exposure. Surprisingly, after noise exposure, the electrophysiological properties of the auditory receptors remain unchanged, despite a decrease in the ability to transduce sound. This auditory deficit stems from changes in a specialized receptor lymph that bathes the auditory receptors, revealing striking parallels with the mammalian auditory system.

We study cells with respect to the p-canonical basis of the Hecke algebra of a crystallographic Coxeter system (see Jensen and Williamson in Categorification and higher representation theory, American Mathematical Society, Providence, 2017). Our main technical tools are the star-operations introduced by Kazhdan-Lusztig (Invent. Math. 53(2):65-184, 1979) which have interesting numerical consequences for the p-canonical basis. As an application, we explicitly describe p-cells in finite type A (i.e. for symmetric groups) using the Robinson-Schensted correspondence. Moreover, we show that Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in finite types B and C decompose into p-cells for p>2.

Our purpose consists in analyzing the actual reach of these searches for a full model and in emphasizing effects beyond the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) that affect the performance of current (MSSM-inspired) electroweakino searches. To this end, we consider several scenarios characterizing specific features of the NMSSM electroweakino sector. We then perform a detailed collider study, generating Monte Carlo events through PYTHIA and testing against current LHC constraints implemented in the public tool CheckMATE. We find e.g., that supersymmetric decay chains involving intermediate singlino or Higgs-singlet states can modify the naive MSSM-like picture of the constraints by inducing final states with softer or less easily identifiable SM particles-reversely, a compressed configuration with singlino next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle occasionally induces final states that are rich with photons, which could provide complementary search channels.

First, the measurements by Rosetta instruments are described, as well as relevant characteristics of 67P. The complex picture of the activity of 67P, with its extreme North-South seasonal asymmetry, is presented. Individual estimates of the dust-to-gas and refractory-to-ice mass ratios are then presented and compared, showing wide ranges of plausible values. Rosetta's wealth of information suggests that estimates of the dust-to-gas mass ratio made in cometary comae at a single point in time may not be fully representative of the refractory-to-ice mass ratio within the cometary nuclei being observed.

The [CII] 158 mu m far-infrared fine-structure line is one of the most important cooling lines of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM). It is used as a tracer of star formation efficiency in external galaxies and to study feedback effects in parental clouds. High spectral resolution observations have shown complex structures in the line profiles of the [CII] emission.Aims. Our aim is to determine whether the complex profiles observed in [(CII)-C-12] are due to individual velocity components along the line-of-sight or to self-absorption based on a comparison of the [(CII)-C-12] and isotopic [(CII)-C-13] line profiles.Methods. Deep integrations with the SOFIA/upGREAT 7-pixel array receiver in the sources of M43, Horsehead PDR, Monoceros R2, and M17 SW allow for the detection of optically thin [(CII)-C-13] emission lines, along with the [(CII)-C-12] emission lines, with a high signal-to-noise ratio. We first derived the [(CII)-C-12] optical depth and the [CII] column density from a single component model. However, the complex line profiles observed require a double layer model with an emitting background and an absorbing foreground. A multi-component velocity fit allows us to derive the physical conditions of the [CII] gas: column density and excitation temperature.Results. We find moderate to high [(CII)-C-12] optical depths in all four sources and self-absorption of [(CII)-C-12] in Mon R2 and M17 SW. The high column density of the warm background emission corresponds to an equivalent A(v) of up to 41 mag. The foreground absorption requires substantial column densities of cold and dense [CII] gas, with an equivalent A(v) ranging up to about 13 mag.Conclusions. The column density of the warm background material requires multiple photon-dominated region surfaces stacked along the line of sight and in velocity. The substantial column density of dense and cold foreground [CII] gas detected in absorption cannot be explained with any known scenario and we can only speculate on its origins.

Manual recognition is a time-consuming and laborious process that places a heavy burden on neurologists, and hence, the automatic identification of epilepsy has become an important issue. Traditional EEG recognition models largely depend on artificial experience and are of weak generalization ability. To break these limitations, we propose a novel one-dimensional deep neural network for robust detection of seizures, which composes of three convolutional blocks and three fully connected layers. Thereinto, each convolutional block consists of five types of layers: convolutional layer, batch normalization layer, nonlinear activation layer, dropout layer, and max-pooling layer. Model performance is evaluated on the University of Bonn dataset, which achieves the accuracy of 97.63%similar to 99.52% in the two-class classification problem, 96.73%similar to 98.06% in the three-class EEG classification problem, and 93.55% in classifying the complicated five-class problem.

"In situ similis" Culturing of Plant Microbiota: A Novel Simulated Environmental Method Based on Plant Leaf Blades as Nutritional Pads	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						plant microbiota; plant-based culture media; endophyllosphere; endorhizosphere; MALDI-TOF-MS; culturomics; arid; semi-arid zones	TOF MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ELECTROLYTE LEAKAGE; ENDOPHYTIC BACTERIA; CULTIVATION; SUNFLOWER; RHIZOSPHERE; DIVERSITY; GROWTH; TOOL; MICROORGANISMS	High-throughput cultivation methods have recently been developed to accelerate the recovery of microorganisms reluctant to cultivation. They simulate in situ environmental conditions for the isolation of environmental microbiota through the exchange of growth substrates during cultivation. Here, we introduce leaf-based culture media adopting the concept of the plant being the master architect of the composition of its microbial community. Pre-physical treatments of sunflower plant leaves, namely punching, freezing, and/or autoclavation, allowed the diffusion of electrolytes and other nutrients to configure the leaf surface as a natural pad, i.e., creating an "in situ similis" environment suitable for the growth of rarely isolated microbiota. We used surface inoculation and membrane-filtration methods to assess the culturability of endophytic bacteria from the sunflower phyllosphere and rhizosphere. Both methods supported excellent colony-forming unit (CFU) development when compared to standard R2A medium, with a special affinity to support better growth of epiphytic and endophytic populations of the phyllosphere compared with the rhizosphere. A 16S rRNA gene analysis of >122 representative isolates indicated the cultivation of a diverse set of microorganisms by application of the new methods. It indicated the predominance of 13 genera of >30 potential species, belonging to Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, and especially genera not commonly reported for sunflower, e.g., Rhizobium, Aureimonas, Sphingomonas, Paracoccus, Stenotrophomonas, Pantoea, Kosakonia, and Erwinia. The strategy successfully extended diversity and richness in the endophyllosphere compared to the endorhizosphere, while CFUs grown on the standard R2A medium mainly pertain to Firmicutes, especially Bacillus spp. MALDI-TOF MS analysis clustered the isolates according to their niche and potential functions, where the majority of isolates of the endorhizosphere were clustered away from those of the endophyllosphere. Isolates identified as Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were distinguishably sub-clustered, which was in contrast to the heterogeneous isolates of Firmicutes (Bacillus spp.). In conclusion, leaf in situ similis cultivation is an effective strategy to support the future application of culturomics of plant microbiota. This is an effort to access novel isolates that are more adapted and competitive in their natural environments, especially those subjected to abiotic stresses like those prevailing in arid/semi-arid zones, and, consequently, to support the application of agro-biotechnologies, among other technologies, to improving agriculture in such zones.

Myco-DES: Enabling Remote Extraction of Mycotoxins for Robust and Reliable Quantification by Stable Isotope Dilution LC-MS/MS	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DRIED BLOOD SPOTS; FOOD	Mycotoxins remain a global threat to human and animal health, especially in countries lacking effective measures to detect and control contaminated commodities. As the quantification of mycotoxins usually relies on complex and expensive techniques, the availability of suitable instrumentation is often a bottleneck in reliable mycotoxin detection. As part of our research toward strategies offering widespread access to mycotoxin analysis while cutting down on costs, we present a new extraction and quantification protocol combining materials originally designed for dried blood spot analysis with stable isotope dilution analysis. Its key benefits are that extraction of mycotoxins can be carried out at remote sites and by minimally trained personnel, while quantification will take place in specialized central laboratories simply connected by regular, paper-based mail. As a proof of concept, aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and deoxynivalenol were extracted from cereal-based foodstuffs, fixed on paper cards for transport, and successfully quantified after re-extraction by stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS analysis. Several materials (cellulose/polyethylene terephthalate/glass fiber, nontreated/chemically treated) as well as possible transport and storage conditions (temperature, humidity) were evaluated. The final myco-DES (dried extract spots) protocol allows quantification of mycotoxin levels currently recognized as safe (aflatoxin B-1: 2 mu g/kg, ochratoxin A: 3 mu g/kg, deoxynivalenol: 500 mu g/kg) after a storage of up to 4 weeks under tropical climate conditions (40 degrees C, 75% relative humidity).

Together with CDK4, it phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. In tumour cells, CDK6 is frequently upregulated and CDK4/6 kinase inhibitors like palbociclib possess high activity in breast cancer and other malignancies. Besides its crucial catalytic function, kinase-independent roles of CDK6 have been described. Therefore, targeted degradation of CDK6 may be advantageous over kinase inhibition. Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) structurally based on the cereblon (CRBN) ligand thalidomide have recently been described to degrade the targets CDK4/6. However, CRBN-based PROTACs have several limitations including the remaining activity of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) on Ikaros transcription factors as well as CRBN inactivation as a resistance mechanism in cancer. Here, we systematically explored the chemical space of CDK4/6 PROTACs by addressing different E3 ligases and connecting their respective small-molecule binders via various linkers to palbociclib. The spectrum of CDK6-specific PROTACs was extended to von Hippel Lindau (VHL) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) that are essential for most cancer cells and therefore less likely to be inactivated. Our VHL-based PROTAC series included compounds that were either specific for CDK6 or exhibited dual activity against CDK4 and CDK6. IAP-based PROTACs caused a combined degradation of CDK4/6 and IAPs resulting in synergistic effects on cancer cell growth. Our new degraders showed potent and long-lasting degrading activity in human and mouse cells and inhibited proliferation of several leukemia, myeloma and breast cancer cell lines. In conclusion, we show that VHL- and IAP-based PROTACs are an attractive approach for targeted degradation of CDK4/6 in cancer.

ATLAS Collaboration	Search for chargino-neutralino production with mass splittings near the electroweak scale in three-lepton final states in root s=13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							E(+)E(-) COLLISIONS; CROSS-SECTION; SUPERSYMMETRY; EXTENSION; DECAY	A search for supersymmetry through the pair production of electroweakinos with mass splittings near the electroweak scale and decaying via on-shell W and Z bosons is presented for a three-lepton final state. The analyzed proton-proton collision data taken at a center-of-mass energy of root s = 13 TeV were collected between 2015 and 2018 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb(-1). A search, emulating the recursive jigsaw reconstruction technique with easily reproducible laboratory-frame variables, is performed. The two excesses observed in the 2015-2016 data recursive jigsaw analysis in the low-mass three-lepton phase space are reproduced. Results with the full data set are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations. They are interpreted to set exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level on simplified models of chargino-neutralino pair production for masses up to 345 GeV.

We unify and generalize several previous models for dynamic map labeling into one versatile and flexible model. In contrast to previous research, we completely abstract from the particular operations and express the labeling problem as a set of time intervals representing the labels' presences, activities and conflicts. One of the model's strength is manifested in its simplicity and broad range of applications. In particular, it supports label selection both for map features with fixed position as well as for moving entities (e.g., for tracking vehicles in logistics or air traffic control). We study the active range maximization problem in this model. We prove that the problem is NP-complete and W[1]-hard, and present constant-factor approximation algorithms. In the restricted, yet practically relevant case that no more than k labels can be active at any time, we give polynomial-time algorithms as well as constant-factor approximation algorithms.

Silica entry and accumulation in standing trees in a hot-spring environment: cellular pathways, rapid pace and fossilization potential	PALAEONTOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						hot springs; Pinus contorta; in situ fossilization; silica; taphonomy; wood	YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; CONIFER WOOD; VOLCANIC ASH; SILICIFICATION; GEOCHEMISTRY; EXAMPLES; PLANTS	Silicification is the most important process of fossilization resulting in the preservation of internal tissues in plants, thereby providing essential information on the anatomy, life history, and evolution of land plants. However, fundamental knowledge of silica uptake, precipitation, and contribution to in situ plant fossilization is limited. To identify the cellular pathway of aqueous silica and subsequent fluid-wood interaction processes, we investigated upright standing young trees of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in the hot-spring environment of Cistern Spring, Yellowstone National Park, USA. Our multi-method analytical approach using x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electron probe microanalyses shows that the surficial and internally co-precipitated silica-halite-gypsum assemblage traces the flow of silica-rich fluid and documents fluid retention after short-term hot-spring water immersion and evaporation. Element distribution maps reveal systematic 2D and 3D differences between silica quantities deposited in earlywood and latewood. The distribution of inorganic impurities in cell walls traces the anatomical structure of the wood and indicates rapid migration of homogeneous fluid into the waterlogged organic substrate. Our results show that the preferential pathway of silica-rich fluid into the above-ground wood was through the decorticated periphery which took place during a short-term flooding, ranging from days to weeks, of hot-spring fluid. In conclusion, the fluid retention capability in cellular pore space controls the in situ silicification process. The silicification of trees in growth position is a rapid process in which the in vivo transport of silica-rich fluid upward through the secondary xylem plays an insignificant role.

Objective To better characterize the natural history of the most common SCAs, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6, we performed a meta-analysis of literature to determine disease progression, provide data for sample-sizes calculations for interventional trials and study the impact of geographical locations and study follow-up on disease progression. Methods A systematic literature search from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for longitudinal natural history studies of SCA patients was conducted. Studies using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating Ataxia (SARA) as outcome measure were considered. Random-effect (RE) meta-analysis was applied to estimate pooled disease progression. Results Six studies with 1215 SCA patients enrolled between 2005 and 2016 were finally selected. Annual pooled SARA score increase was 1.83 (1.46-2.20) in patients with SCA1, 1.40 (1.19-1.61) in patients with SCA2, 1.41 (0.97-1.84) in patients with SCA3, and 0.81 (0.66-0.97) in patients with SCA6. For patients with SCA3, disease progression was faster in studies located in Asia and Europe than in the US. Two-arm interventional trials of 1-year duration to achieve 80% power and alpha level of 5% would require 92 patients per group with SCA1, 97 with SCA2, 115 with SCA3, and 430 with SCA6 to detect a 50% reduction in disease progression. Conclusion This meta-analysis provides quantitative data on the progression of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias based on patient numbers that exceed those of previous studies and confirms that disease progression is faster in SCA1, intermediate in SCA2 and SCA3 and slower in SCA6, with similar rates of disease progression in SCA2 and SCA3 between different populations, suggesting a possibility of international collaborative studies. Nevertheless, individual-patient data meta-analysis is needed to better understand the risk factors that influence disease progression and improve patient stratification in interventional trials.

Plant functional types (PFTs) and their distribution, frequently applied in ecological studies and biome modelling, serve as a tool for reconstructing palaeovegetation units and ultimately tracing palaeoecological/climate gradients. Earlier quantitative studies focusing on distribution patterns of PFTs and designed to put forward data-model comparisons were carried out on well-dated Middle and Late Miocene floras. Moreover, the PFT approach has been successfully applied to reconstruct Eocene vegetation patterns in several time slices at a global scale as well as in regional vegetation reconstructions throughout the Cenozoic. In the current study, a PFT approach with 41 different classes is applied on Rupelian and Chattian fossil floras of Europe and western Asia to infer spatial vegetation differences across the study area. A comprehensive palaeobotanical record including similar to 163 macro- (leaves, fruits and seeds) and microfloras was compiled. The floristic components of these palaeofloras are translated to PFTs including herbaceous to arboreal classes. The PFTs are defined using traits and climatic thresholds of key taxa, and comprise species assigned by morphological and phenological features with respect to the related ecosystem. Diversity values of each PFT are calculated for the fossil floras and spatial gradients over western Eurasia are investigated for the Rupelian and Chattian. PFT diversity maps and transects for both time slices reveal basic patterns of the vegetational structure at the continental scale. It is shown that in both time slices studied tropical and broadleaved evergreen PFTs were more diverse in the West and at lower latitudes. Consistently with the global climate evolution as known from marine archives and regional continental records their level was higher in the Rupelian compared to the Chattian. All over low diversities of xeric PFTs coincide with the previously assumed dominance of humid climate conditions in western Eurasia throughout the Oligocene, however, the reconstructed spatial gradients suggest somewhat drier conditions to the southwest and southeast of the study area.

Update of P2Y receptor pharmacology: IUPHAR Review 27	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access							SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; P2Y(12) RECEPTOR; NUCLEOTIDE RECEPTORS; CONCISE GUIDE; ACTIVE METABOLITE; PURINERGIC REGULATION; SELECTIVE AGONISTS; EXTRACELLULAR ATP; PLATELET P2Y(1); ANTAGONIST	Eight G protein-coupled P2Y receptor subtypes respond to extracellular adenine and uracil mononucleotides and dinucleotides. P2Y receptors belong to the delta group of rhodopsin-like GPCRs and contain two structurally distinct subfamilies: P2Y(1), P2Y(2), P2Y(4), P2Y(6), and P2Y(11) (principally G(q) protein-coupled P2Y(1)-like) and P2Y(12-14) (principally G(i) protein-coupled P2Y(12)-like) receptors. Brain P2Y receptors occur in neurons, glial cells, and vasculature. Endothelial P2Y(1), P2Y(2), P2Y(4), and P2Y(6) receptors induce vasodilation, while smooth muscle P2Y(2), P2Y(4), and P2Y(6) receptor activation leads to vasoconstriction. Pancreatic P2Y(1) and P2Y(6) receptors stimulate while P2Y(13) receptors inhibits insulin secretion. Antagonists of P2Y(12) receptors, and potentially P2Y(1) receptors, are anti-thrombotic agents, and a P2Y(2)/P2Y(4) receptor agonist treats dry eye syndrome in Asia. P2Y receptor agonists are generally pro-inflammatory, and antagonists may eventually treat inflammatory conditions. This article reviews recent developments in P2Y receptor pharmacology (using synthetic agonists and antagonists), structure and biophysical properties (using X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis and modelling), physiological and pathophysiological roles, and present and potentially future therapeutic targeting.

Methods: In this randomized, cross-over phase IV study, 77 patients were recruited in 26 sites in Germany. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either capecitabine plus bevacizumab (Cap+Bev) as first-line therapy followed by cross-over to everolimus plus exemestane (Eve+Exe) as second-line therapy (Arm A) or the reverse sequence (Arm B). The primary endpoint was patients' preference for either regimen, assessed by the Patient Preference Questionnaire 12 weeks after cross-over. Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, and quality of life (QoL). Results: 61.5% of patients preferred Cap+Bev (p = 0.1653), whereas 15.4% preferred Eve+Exe and 23.1% were indecisive. Physicians showed a similar tendency towards Cap+Bev (58.1%) as the preferred regimen versus Eve+Exe (32.3%). Median first-line PFS was longer for Cap+Bev than for Eve+Exe (11.1 months versus 3.5 months). Median second-line PFS was similar between Cap+Bev and Eve+Exe (3.6 months versus 3.7 months). Median OS was comparable between Arm A (28.8 months) and Arm B (24.7 months). 73.0% and 52.6% (first-/second-line, Cap+Bev) and 54.1% and 52.9% (first-/second-line, Eve+Exe) of patients experienced grade 3/4 TEAEs. No treatment-related deaths occurred. QoL and treatment satisfaction were not significantly different between arms or treatment lines. Conclusions: Patients tended to favor Cap+Bev over Eve+Exe, which was in line with physicians' preference. Cap+Bev showed superior first-line PFS, while QoL was similar in both arms. No new safety signals were reported.

The effect of the environment-dependent IMF on the formation and metallicities of stars over the cosmic history	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies; abundances; galaxies; stellar content; galaxies; star formation; stars; abundances; stars; formation	INITIAL MASS FUNCTION; H-ALPHA; POPULATION SYNTHESIS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ABUNDANCE RATIOS; GALAXIES; SUPERNOVAE; MODELS; UV	Recent observational and theoretical studies indicate that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) varies systematically with the environment (star formation rate - SFR, metallicity). Although the exact dependence of the IMF on those properties is likely to change with improving observational constraints, the reported trend in the shape of the IMF appears robust. We present the first study aiming to evaluate the effect of the IMF variations on the measured cosmic SFR density (SFRD) as a function of metallicity and redshift, f(SFR)(Z, z). We also study the expected number and metallicity of white dwarf, neutron star, and black hole progenitors under different IMF assumptions. Applying the empirically driven IMF variations described by the integrated galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory, we revise f(SFR)(Z, z) obtained in our previous study that assumed a universal IMF. We find a lower SFRD at high redshifts and a higher fraction of metal-poor stars being formed than previously determined. In the local Universe, our calculation applying the IGIMF theory suggests more white dwarf and neutron star progenitors in comparison with the universal IMF scenario, while the number of black hole progenitors remains unaffected.

J	Grunhage, T; Reuter, M				Gruenhage, Thomas; Reuter, Martin			Political Orientation is Associated with Behavior in Public-Goods- and Trust-Games	POLITICAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article; Early Access						Ideology; Behavioral economics; Trust-game; Public-goods-game; SDO; RWA	PERSONALITY; OXYTOCIN; PREJUDICE; PREFERENCES; COMPETITION; LIBERALISM; ATTITUDES; IDEOLOGY; IMPACT; BRAIN	To examine whether political orientation is reflected in actual behavior, we applied classical paradigms of behavioral economics, namely the Public-Goods- (PGG) and the Trust-Game (TG) which constitute measures of cooperativeness, interpersonal trust and reciprocity respectively in a large German sample of N = 454. Participants intending to vote for right-of-center-parties showed significantly lower monetary transfers in both games than those intending to vote for left-of-center-parties. Accordingly, both scores were negatively associated with self-assessed conservatism and support for policies advocated by Germany's right-of-center-parties, while showing positive correlations with the support of policies left-of-center-parties advocate. Interestingly, both measures also show distinct correlational patterns with Right-Wing-Authoritarianism and Social-Dominance-Orientation. None of these patterns applied to the Lottery-Game measuring unspecific risk-tolerance. We conclude by discussing potential psychological mechanisms mediating the relationships between ideology and actual social behavior as well as differences in experimental design to explain the deviant pattern of (null-) results in former studies relating ideology to behavior in game-theoretic paradigms.

Questioning the spatial origin of complex organic molecules in young protostars with the CALYPSO survey star star star	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						astrochemistry; stars; formation; ISM; abundances	IRAS 16293-2422; HOT CORE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; OUTFLOW CAVITY; MASS; CHEMISTRY; EVOLUTION; ABUNDANCES; CORINOS; SERPENS	Context. Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected in a few Class 0 protostars but their origin is not well understood. While the usual picture of a hot corino explains their presence as resulting from the heating of the inner envelope by the nascent protostar, shocks in the outflow, disk wind, the presence of a flared disk, or the interaction region between envelope and disk at the centrifugal barrier have also been claimed to enhance the abundance of COMs. Aims. Going beyond studies of individual objects, we want to investigate the origin of COMs in young protostars on a statistical basis. Methods. We use the CALYPSO survey performed with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer of the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique to search for COMs at high angular resolution in a sample of 26 solar-type protostars, including 22 Class 0 and four Class I objects. We derive the column densities of the detected molecules under the local thermodynamic equilibrium approximation and search for correlations between their abundances and with various source properties. Results. Methanol is detected in 12 sources and tentatively in one source, which represents half of the sample. Eight sources (30%) have detections of at least three COMs. We find a strong chemical differentiation in multiple systems with five systems having one component with at least three COMs detected but the other component devoid of COM emission. All sources with a luminosity higher than 4 L-circle dot have at least one detected COM whereas no COM emission is detected in sources with internal luminosity lower than 2 L-circle dot, likely because of a lack of sensitivity. Internal luminosity is found to be the source parameter impacting the COM chemical composition of the sources the most, while there is no obvious correlation between the detection of COM emission and that of a disk-like structure. A canonical hot-corino origin may explain the COM emission in four sources, an accretion-shock origin in two or possibly three sources, and an outflow origin in three sources. The CALYPSO sources with COM detections can be classified into three groups on the basis of the abundances of oxygen-bearing molecules, cyanides, and CHO-bearing molecules. These chemical groups correlate neither with the COM origin scenarios, nor with the evolutionary status of the sources if we take the ratio of envelope mass to internal luminosity as an evolutionary tracer. We find strong correlations between molecules that are a priori not related chemically (for instance methanol and methyl cyanide), implying that the existence of a correlation does not imply a chemical link. Conclusions. The CALYPSO survey has revealed a chemical differentiation in multiple systems that is markedly different from the case of the prototypical binary IRAS 16293-2422. This raises the question of whether all low-mass protostars go through a phase showing COM emission. A larger sample of young protostars and a more accurate determination of their internal luminosity will be necessary to make further progress. Searching for correlations between the COM emission and the jet/outflow properties of the sources may also be promising.

Using data collected by the Belle II experiment during 2018 at the SuperKEKB collider, we perform the first searches for the invisible decay of a Z' in the process e(+)e(-) -> mu(+)mu(-) Z' and of a lepton-flavor-violating Z' in e(+) e(-) -> e(+/-)mu(-/+)Z'. We do not find any excess of events and set 90% credibility level upper limits on the cross sections of these processes. We translate the former, in the framework of an L, - L, theory, into upper limits on the Z' coupling constant at the level of 5 x 10(-2) - 1 for M-z' <= 6 GeV/c(2).	[Jia, S.; Shen, C. P.; Zhou, X.

J	Buhler, H				Buehler, Heinz			Dieter Janz and the Michael Foundation A story over almost 60 years	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EPILEPTOLOGIE			German	Article						Dr; Fritz Harzendorf; Michael Prize; Practical epilepsy seminar in Gargnano; Education and training in epileptology; Epilepsy advisory board		The Michael Foundation was established in 1962. The only two "survivors" of the first years of the Foundation, apart from Michael-Agathe Buhler, daughter of the founder Dr. Fritz Harzendorf, following the death of her father in 1964 lifelong member of the advisory board of the Foundation and the author of this article as a young probationary judge and managing director from 1966 to 1969-look back to these first years of the Foundation and its later development. They are pleased and proud of the decision of Fritz Harzendorf to establish this Foundation and feel a deep gratitude towards Dieter Janz. His vision, passion, knowledge and personal involvement were the driving forces for a dynamic development of the Foundation and the reputation it was able to acquire in Germany and in the international epileptology community. But perhaps the Foundation also helped Dieter Janz to achieve what might not have been possible for him without the Foundation. The author looks back to the time and the situation at the time of the beginning of the Michael Foundation, to the first years of its existence, its further development and to the important role that Dieter Janz played in it.

J	Lubbecke, S; Schnedler, W				Luebbecke, Silvia; Schnedler, Wendelin			Don't patronize me! An experiment on preferences for authorship	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Review							PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP; FAIRNESS	Do people only reject interference and keep control to affect the outcome? We find that 20% of subjects reject unrequired help and insist on their solution to a problem-although doing so is costly and does not change the result. We tease out the motives by varying the information available to the interfering party (paternalist). Subjects do not resist to show to the paternalist that they were able to find the correct solution. Instead, two motives seem to play a role. First, subjects prefer to have produced or "authored" the solution themselves. Second, subjects desire to signal their authorship and hence their independence to the paternalist.

It is an annual species with a remarkably small and compact genome. Single accessions of the plant have been shown to be related to the cosmopolitan perennial hornwort Anthoceros punctatus. We provide the first detailed insight into the evolutionary history of the two species. Due to the rather conserved nature of organellar loci, we sequenced multiple accessions in the Anthoceros agrestis-A. punctatus complex using three nuclear regions: the ribosomal spacer ITS2, and exon and intron regions from the single-copy coding genes rbcS and phytochrome. We used phylogenetic and dating analyses to uncover the relationships between these two taxa. Our analyses resolve a lineage of genetically near-uniform European A. agrestis accessions and two non-European A. agrestis lineages. In addition, the cosmopolitan species Anthoceros punctatus forms two lineages, one of mostly European accessions, and another from India. All studied European A. agrestis accessions have a single origin, radiated relatively recently (less than 1 million years ago), and are currently strictly associated with agroecosystem habitats.

J	Lucke, P				Luecke, Philipp			Partition properties for simply definable colourings	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							CARDINALS; CONSISTENCY; SUBSETS; CHANG	We study partition properties for uncountable regular cardinals that arise by restricting partition properties defining large cardinal notions to classes of simply definable colourings. We show that both large cardinal assumptions and forcing axioms imply that there is a homogeneous closed unbounded subset of omega(1) for every colouring of the finite sets of countable ordinals that is definable by a sigma(1)-formula that only uses the cardinal omega(1) and real numbers as parameters. Moreover, it is shown that certain large cardinal properties cause analogous partition properties to hold at the given large cardinal and these implications yield natural examples of inaccessible cardinals that possess strong partition properties for sigma(1)-definable colourings and are not weakly compact. In contrast, we show that sigma(1)- definability behaves fundamentally different at omega(2) by showing that various large cardinal assumptions and Martin's Maximum are compatible with the existence of a colouring of pairs of elements of omega(2) that is definable by a sigma(1)-formula with parameter omega(2) and has no uncountable homogeneous set. Our results will also allow us to derive tight bounds for the consistency strengths of various partition properties for definable colourings. Finally, we use the developed theory to study the question whether certain homeomorphisms that witness failures of weak compactness at small cardinals can be simply definable.

Purpose/Hypothesis To determine the effect of automated, color-coded coregistration (AC) of fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences on diagnostic accuracy, certainty, and reading time compared to conventional follow-up MRI assessment of astrocytoma patients. Study Type Retrospective. Population In all, 41 patients with neuropathologically confirmed astrocytoma. Field Strength/Sequence 1.0-3.0T/FLAIR Assessment The presence or absence of tumor progression was determined based on FLAIR sequences, contrast-enhanced T-1 sequences, and clinical data. Three radiologists assessed 47 MRI study pairs in a conventional reading (CR) and in a second reading supported by AC after 6 weeks. Readers determined the presence/absence of tumor progression and indicated diagnostic certainty on a 5-point Likert scale. Reading time was recorded by an independent assessor. Statistical Tests The Wilcoxon test was used to assess reading time and diagnostic certainty. Differences in diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were analyzed with the McNemar mid-p test. Results Readers attained significantly higher overall sensitivity (0.86 vs. 0.75; P < 0.05) and diagnostic accuracy (0.84 vs. 0.73; P < 0.05) for detection of progressive nonenhancing tumor burden when using AC compared to CR. There was a strong trend towards higher specificity within the AC-augmented reading, yet without statistical significance (0.83 vs. 0.71; P = 0.08). Sensitivity for unequivocal disease progression was similarly high in both approaches (AC: 0.94, CR: 0.92), while for marginal disease progressions, it was significantly higher in AC (AC: 0.78, CR: 0.58; P < 0.05). Reading time including application loading time was comparable (AC: 38.1 +/- 16.8 sec, CR: 36.0 +/- 18.9 s; P = 0.25). Data Conclusion Compared to CR, AC improves comparison of FLAIR signal hyperintensity at MRI follow-up of astrocytoma patients, allowing for a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy, particularly for subtle disease progression at a comparable reading time.

Currently, only FC-type diterpene synthases (DTSs) for 3 of the 16 possible stereochemically distinct subtypes of the FC skeleton have been discovered. Herein, a (2si,6si,10re,14si)-FC-type DTS from Myrothecium gramineum is reported, which produces the diterpene alcohol myrothec-15(17)-en-7-ol. On the basis of homology modelings, the I189F variant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis that prevents the penultimate carbocation from water attack, resulting in the deprotonation product myrotheca-7,15(17)-diene. Vibrational circular dichroism calculations in combination with chemical correlations through an enantioselective labeling strategy established the absolute configurations of these diterpenes. Density functional theory calculations revealed a water-mediated proton transfer mechanism, which is supported by isotope labeling experiments, in contrast to the deprotonation/reprotonation mechanism reported in previous studies.

Event Horizon Telescope Collaborat	SYMBA: An end-to-end VLBI synthetic data generation pipeline Simulating Event Horizon Telescope observations of M 87	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies; nuclei; black hole physics; telescopes; atmospheric effects; techniques; high angular resolution; techniques; interferometric	SGR A-ASTERISK; BLACK-HOLE; RADIO; JET; DISTRIBUTIONS; CALIBRATION; MODELS; INTERFEROMETER; FIELD; M87	Context. Realistic synthetic observations of theoretical source models are essential for our understanding of real observational data. In using synthetic data, one can verify the extent to which source parameters can be recovered and evaluate how various data corruption effects can be calibrated. These studies are the most important when proposing observations of new sources, in the characterization of the capabilities of new or upgraded instruments, and when verifying model-based theoretical predictions in a direct comparison with observational data. Aims. We present the SYnthetic Measurement creator for long Baseline Arrays (SYMBA), a novel synthetic data generation pipeline for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. SYMBA takes into account several realistic atmospheric, instrumental, and calibration effects. Methods. We used SYMBA to create synthetic observations for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a millimetre VLBI array, which has recently captured the first image of a black hole shadow. After testing SYMBA with simple source and corruption models, we study the importance of including all corruption and calibration effects, compared to the addition of thermal noise only. Using synthetic data based on two example general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) model images of M 87, we performed case studies to assess the image quality that can be obtained with the current and future EHT array for different weather conditions. Results. Our synthetic observations show that the effects of atmospheric and instrumental corruptions on the measured visibilities are significant. Despite these effects, we demonstrate how the overall structure of our GRMHD source models can be recovered robustly with the EHT2017 array after performing calibration steps, which include fringe fitting, a priori amplitude and network calibration, and self-calibration. With the planned addition of new stations to the EHT array in the coming years, images could be reconstructed with higher angular resolution and dynamic range. In our case study, these improvements allowed for a distinction between a thermal and a non-thermal GRMHD model based on salient features in reconstructed images.

Cytosolic, but not matrix, calcium is essential for adjustment of mitochondrial pyruvate supply	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						mouse; mitochondria; respiratory chain; calcium; bioenergetics; malate-aspartate shuttle; mitochondrial calcium uniporter; cytosolic calcium; OXPHOS control; synaptosomes; thymocytes; fibroblasts; isolated working rat heart	MALATE-ASPARTATE SHUTTLE; OXIDATIVE-PHOSPHORYLATION; BRAIN MITOCHONDRIA; MICE LACKING; RAT-HEART; RESPIRATION; DEFICIENCY; HOMEOSTASIS; STRESS; CA2+	Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and cellular workload are tightly balanced by the key cellular regulator, calcium (Ca2+). Current models assume that cytosolic Ca2+ regulates workload and that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake precedes activation of matrix dehydrogenases, thereby matching OXPHOS substrate supply to ATP demand. Surprisingly, knockout (KO) of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) in mice results in only minimal phenotypic changes and does not alter OXPHOS. This implies that adaptive activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases by intramitochondrial Ca2+ cannot be the exclusive mechanism for OXPHOS control. We hypothesized that cytosolic Ca2+, but not mitochondrial matrix Ca2+, may adapt OXPHOS to workload by adjusting the rate of pyruvate supply from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Here, we studied the role of malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS)-dependent substrate supply in OXPHOS responses to changing Ca2+ concentrations in isolated brain and heart mitochondria, synaptosomes, fibroblasts, and thymocytes from WT and MCU KO mice and the isolated working rat heart. Our results indicate that extramitochondrial Ca2+ controls up to 85% of maximal pyruvate-driven OXPHOS rates, mediated by the activity of the complete MAS, and that intramitochondrial Ca2+ accounts for the remaining 15%. Of note, the complete MAS, as applied here, included besides its classical NADH oxidation reaction the generation of cytosolic pyruvate. Part of this largely neglected mechanism has previously been described as the ?mitochondrial gas pedal.? Its implementation into OXPHOS control models integrates seemingly contradictory results and warrants a critical reappraisal of metabolic control mechanisms in health and disease.

Most strikingly our surveys show that a majority of the community disagrees that the Paris Agreement has reduced the possibility of the world reaching dangerous levels of climate change. Consistent with this, around two thirds of people consulted are considering high-end climate change or using high-end scenarios in their work all the time, or starting to. However, this is still not done by all. Preparedness for the specific threats posed by high-end impacts is not keeping pace, and more work needs to be done to strengthen the research basis and understand adaptation needs under high-end climate change. Moreover, views on finding information on impacts and tools for decision-making have not changed between 2016 and 2018, showing that there is no improvement. This situation underlines that the adaptation community needs to do better in supporting exchange of information and data between all actors-in addition to finding and filling knowledge gaps. Despite this, there is widespread support for avoiding delaying large-scale adaptation until we have more certainty.

Epidemiological trends, predictive factors, and projection of tooth loss in Germany 1997-2030: part II. Edentulism in seniors	CLINICAL ORAL INVESTIGATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						Cross-sectional study; Demography; Epidemiology; Prediction model; Tooth loss	ORAL-HEALTH; DENTAL STATUS; PREVALENCE; POPULATION; SMOKING; ADULT; AGE	Objective This is the second part of a report on tooth loss in Germany 1997-2030. Here, we describe trends in the prevalence of edentulism in seniors 1997-2014, assess predictive factors for edentulism, and projected it into 2030. Material and methods We used data from three waves of the cross-sectional, multi-center, nationwide representative German Oral Health Studies. Overall, 3449 seniors (65-74 years) were included (1997: 1367; 2005: 1040; 2016: 1042). Age, sex, educational level, smoking status, and the cohort were entered into age-cohort binary-logistic regression models to assess the association of predictors with edentulism and to project edentulism in 2030 via Monte Carlo simulations. Results Between 1997 and 2014, the prevalence of edentulism decreased from 24.8 to 12.4%. With each year of age, the risk of being edentate increased (by 11%, p < 0.001); it was also significantly increased in female versus male (by 40%, p = 0.001), low versus medium and high educational level (up to 257%, p < 0.001), and in former and current smokers (up to 258%, p < 0.001). We predict the prevalence of edentulism to be reduced to 4.2% in 2030. The reduction will be higher in males, never and former smokers, and those with low socio-educational level. On an absolute level and despite a growing elderly population (aged 60-80 years), the number of edentate individuals will have decreased by 3.6 million in 2030 compared with 1997. Conclusions Edentulism in seniors has declined equitably in Germany. The decline is expected to continue until 2030. Further efforts are needed to tackle the underlying risk factors.

A Rigorous Mathematical Construction of Feynman Path Integrals for the Schrodinger Equation with Magnetic Field	COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS			English	Article; Early Access							OSCILLATORY INTEGRALS; STATIONARY-PHASE; OPERATORS; APPROXIMATION; FORMULAS; SPACE; MAPS	A Feynman path integral formula for the Schrodinger equation with magnetic field is rigorously mathematically realized in terms of infinite dimensional oscillatory integrals. We show (by the example of a linear vector potential) that the requirement of the independence of the integral on the approximation procedure forces the introduction of a counterterm to be added to the classical action functional. This provides a natural explanation for the appearance of a Stratonovich integral in the path integral formula for both the Schrodinger and heat equation with magnetic field.

J	Di Pietro, G				Di Pietro, Giorgio			Does an International Academic Environment Promote Study Abroad?	JOURNAL OF STUDIES IN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						study abroad; academic environment; Italy; internationalization; intergroup contact theory	STUDENTS; PARTICIPATION; INTENT; HOME	Although many studies on international student mobility have examined the impact of individual factors (e.g., gender, age, family background) on students' decision to study abroad, much less attention has been devoted to the role played by the institutional climate and characteristics of one's home university. Using data from an Italian survey containing information on a large number of university students, this research investigated the extent to which a more international academic environment incentivizes students to participate in study abroad programs. A logit model was developed to estimate the effect that the degree of internationalization of one's home university has on the probability that its students will study abroad, while controlling for several student-level factors. The empirical estimates indicate that this effect is significant, suggesting that being part of an international academic environment, where domestic students can interact more frequently with international students, helps motivate them to undertake study abroad. This result stresses the importance of engaging domestic students in the internationalization process of their universities.

Depression, anxiety, delirium and desire to die in palliative care Recommendations of the S3 guideline on palliative care for patients with incurable cancer	NERVENARZT			German	Article; Early Access						Cancer; Quality of life; Psychotherapy; Psychiatry; Guidelines	MENTAL-DISORDERS; PREVALENCE; DEATH; SYMPTOMS; WISHES	Background The aim of palliative care is to optimize the quality of life of patients with incurable advanced diseases. Adequate psychotherapeutic and psychiatric care is essential in this context. Objective This article presents the recommendations of the S3 guideline on palliative care for patients with incurable cancer with regard to psychotherapeutic and psychiatric contents. Material and methods The guideline was developed under the leadership of the German Society for Palliative Medicine (DGP) within the methodological framework of the German Guideline Program in Oncology. Systematic literature reviews were carried out to identify relevant publications in the databases Medline, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo and Embase. Based on the publications included and clinical experience, representatives of 61 professional associations developed and agreed on evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations. Results Out of the total of 15 chapters in the guidelines, four have a special reference to psychiatry or psychotherapy; they cover the topics depression, anxiety, delirium in the dying phase and dealing with the desire to die. These chapters contain a total of 71 recommendations, almost one third of which are evidence-based. In view of the regularly undetected psychological symptoms in patients with incurable cancer, an early assessment is recommended. Optimal control of physical symptoms and support in social and existential matters are general measures that should be provided in addition to non-pharmacological and pharmacological procedures. Conclusion The guideline on palliative care deals with important mental issues that should be considered by all disciplines and professions. The need for research in palliative care remains high.

J	Muller, P; Bergmann, J				Mueller, Patrick; Bergmann, Julian			Orchestrating peace in South Sudan: exploring the effectiveness of the European Union's mediation support	EUROPEAN SECURITY			English	Article; Early Access							CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; EU; AU	Previous research has primarily focused on the EU's high-profile involvement as direct mediator in peace negotiations. Conversely, less attention has been devoted to the EU's support to third parties' mediation efforts, which is a significant component of its mediation activities. Addressing this research gap, this article develops a conceptual framework for the systematic analysis of EU mediation support, identifying key mediation support techniques and the conditions for their success. In terms of mediation support techniques, the EU may rely on "endorsement", "coordination", "assistance", and "lending leverage" to empower and steer third party mediators in line with its mediation objectives and values. We illustrate the utility of the conceptual framework for the EU's support to IGAD in mediating in South Sudan's civil war. We find that the EU has contributed significantly to IGAD's empowerment in terms of endorsement, coordination, assistance, and lending leverage. Simultaneously, our analysis also points to important challenges in the EU-IGAD relationship, which relate to challenges concerning strategic engagement with IGAD's internal politics that are marked by diverging interests and ties of its member states to the conflict parties.

Such structures are flexible which may strongly affect their structure-property relationship. Here, we explore quantum-mechanically the conformational space of a set of tryptophan-rich model peptides. This has become feasible because of the recently proposed meta-dynamics method based on efficient tight-binding (TB) calculations. The TB version of the simplified time-dependent density functional theory (sTD-DFT-xTB) method is used to evaluate the first hyperpolarizability (beta). These new tools enable us to calculate nonlinear optical properties for systems with several thousand atoms and/or to screen large structure ensembles. First, we show that the indole chromophore in tryptophan residues dominates the beta response of these systems. Their relative orientation mostly determines the global beta tensor and affects the static beta response. The results underline the importance of finding low-energy conformers for modeling beta of flexible molecules. Additionally, we compare calculated and extrapolated experimental static beta. The sTD-DFT-xTB method is capable of providing reliable second-harmonic generation values for tryptophan-rich systems at a fraction of the computational cost of the commonly used TD-DFT/TD-HF levels of theory.

Evidence of Capability Changes from Northern India	JOURNAL OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND CAPABILITIES			English	Article						Capability measurement; self-help groups; sustainable development; propensity score matching; Sen; poverty; female empowerment	EMPOWERMENT; MICROFINANCE; HEALTH; MODEL	This paper offers an evaluation of a supported women's self-help programme with over 1.5 million participants in one of the poorest rural regions of the world (Uttar Pradesh, India). Methodologically, it shows how indicators from the direct capability measurement literature can be adapted for programme evaluation in a low-income country setting. Unique data on capabilities across a range of dimensions are then developed for some 6000 women and used to estimate a number of propensity score matching models. The substantive empirical results of these models indicate that many of the capability indicators are higher for programme members, that the difference appears robust, and that there are significant benefits for those from scheduled tribes and lower castes. The discussion highlights two points. First, human development improvements offered by multi-strand programmes can help to explain the paradox as to why nearly 100 million women (in India alone) have participated in self-help programmes despite modest global research evidence for micro-finance impacts on nominal incomes. Second, results argue strongly for the use of capability measures over agency measures focused solely on household decision-making to assess women's empowerment when structural causes of disempowerment, external to the household, are present and significant.

Yet the Syrian war demonstrates the necessity to pay close attention to this twofold process: Analysing YPG, Hizballah and FSA networks, we argue that AGs are more likely to persist and avoid fragmentation in the long-term if they maintain strong linkages with local communities (local anchoring) and functioning linkages across different localities. We introduce here the concept of translocality to war studies, differentiating it from transnationalism. This analytical lens enables us to focus on localities within Syria, which can influence an actor's power position in war decisively, while also being subjected to drastic change by AGs. We conclude that translocality offers insights for the study of civil war as it enables us to grasp the embedding of armed groups - or lack thereof - in local communities; differentiating between actor groups depending on their local anchoring, and observing network dynamics between different localities.

The aim of this post-hoc analysis of the 'Multicentre Local ASsessment of VEntilatory management during General Anaesthesia for Surgery' (LAS VEGAS) study was to examine the ventilator settings of patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures, and to explore the association between perioperative variables and the development of PPCs in neurosurgical patients. Methods Post-hoc analysis of LAS VEGAS study, restricted to patients undergoing neurosurgery. Patients were stratified into groups based on the type of surgery (brain and spine), the occurrence of PPCs and the assess respiratory risk in surgical patients in Catalonia (ARISCAT) score risk for PPCs. Results Seven hundred eighty-four patients were included in the analysis; 408 patients (52%) underwent spine surgery and 376 patients (48%) brain surgery. Median tidal volume (V-T) was 8 ml [Interquartile Range, IQR = 7.3-9] per predicted body weight; median positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 5 [3 to 5] cmH(2)0. Planned recruitment manoeuvres were used in the 6.9% of patients. No differences in ventilator settings were found among the sub-groups. PPCs occurred in 81 patients (10.3%). Duration of anaesthesia (odds ratio, 1.295 [95% confidence interval 1.067 to 1.572]; p = 0.009) and higher age for the brain group (odds ratio, 0.000 [0.000 to 0.189]; p = 0.031), but not intraoperative ventilator settings were independently associated with development of PPCs. Conclusions Neurosurgical patients are ventilated with low V-T and low PEEP, while recruitment manoeuvres are seldom applied. Intraoperative ventilator settings are not associated with PPCs.

However, its involvement in the development and progression of epilepsy is not yet understood. Loss of interastrocytic gap junction (GJ) coupling has been observed in the sclerotic hippocampus of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and in mouse models of MTLE, leading to the suggestion that it plays a causative role in the pathogenesis. To further elucidate this clinically relevant question, we investigated consequences of astrocyte disconnection on the time course and severity of kainate-induced MTLE with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) by comparing mice deficient for astrocytic Cx proteins with wild-type mice (WT). Continuous telemetric EEG recordings and video monitoring performed over a period of 4 weeks after epilepsy induction revealed substantially higher seizure and interictal spike activity during the chronic phase in Cx deficient versus WT mice, while the severity of status epilepticus was not different. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that, despite the elevated chronic seizure activity, astrocyte disconnection did not aggravate the severity of HS. Indeed, the extent of CA1 pyramidal cell loss was similar between the experimental groups, while astrogliosis, granule cell dispersion, angiogenesis, and microglia activation were even reduced in Cx deficient as compared to WT mice. Interestingly, seizure-induced neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus was also independent of astrocytic Cxs.

Once detected, the prognosis of this cancer entity is still very poor. Hence, in spite of some unfavorable prerequisites to systematic screening, the development of a screening concept for Barrett's esophagus (BE) and EAC seems worthwhile. Nowadays, screening for BE and EAC is based on conventional endoscopy, mostly conducted individually in patients with reflux complaints (gastroesophageal reflux disease-GERD). Biopsies are taken obligatorily and are the centerpiece of diagnosis and scheduling of surveillance. So far, endoscopy is the diagnostic gold standard, but it is expensive and obviously lacks effectiveness - 8 of 10 cases of EAC are not detected in endoscopic screening (and surveillance) but by an opportunistic first-time endoscopy. Therefore, new methods for BE/EAC screening are strongly desirable. Research must be concentrated to favor procedures applicable for a screening of the population in a primary care setting. For that, the first step needs to consist of identifying a subgroup of people "at risk", which in a second step can be risk assessed and followed up by endoscopy and biopsy. From all screening variants, which have been actually tested in clinical application and experimental research, biomarker-based techniques seem to be most promising. Among those-under the aspect of costs and practicability-the Cytosponge, in addition with a panel of biomarkers, seemed to be promising in clinical trials.

These appreciations have not only been associated with "expensive yen recessions" resulting from negative effects on exports; since the late 1980s, the strong yen has also raised concerns about a de-industrialisation of the Japanese economy. Against this backdrop, the article investigates the effects of changes to the yen exchange rate on the hollowing out of the Japanese industrial sector. To this end, the article uses both aggregate and industry-specific data to gauge the effects of yen fluctuations on the output and exports of different Japanese industries, exploiting new data for industry-specific real effective exchange rates. Our findings support the view that the periods of yen appreciation had more than just transitory effects on Japanese manufacturing. The results also provide indication of hysteresis effects on manufacturing. While there are certainly also other factors that have contributed to a hollowing out of Japanese industry, a strong yen played a role, too.

J	Brendel, E				Brendel, Elke			Truthmaker maximalism and the truthmaker paradox	SYNTHESE			English	Article						Truthmaker; Truthmaker Maximalism; Truthmaker necessitarianism; Truthmaker paradox; Liar paradox; Godel sentence	EVERY TRUTH	According to truthmaker maximalism, each truth has a truthmaker. Peter Milne has attempted to refute truthmaker maximalism on mere logical grounds via the construction of a self-referential truthmaker sentence M "saying" of itself that it doesn't have a truthmaker. Milne argues that M (similar to a Godel sentence and different from a paradox-generating Liar sentence) turns out to be a true sentence without a truthmaker and thus provides a counterexample to truthmaker maximalism. In this paper, I show that Milne's refutation of truthmaker maximalism does not succeed. In particular, I argue that the notion of truthmaker meets two structural principles which, if added to a formal language of a theory (that allows for diagonalization), are already sufficient to produce a provable contradiction-a contradiction that gives rise to a socalled "Truthmaker paradox". I also address the question of how to possibly resolve the Truthmaker paradox. I thereby show that the Truthmaker paradox, just as the strengthened Liar paradox, yields a "revenge problem" for paracomplete theories and might lead to triviality for Priest's dialetheist account LP if the notion of truthmaker is defined as a certain semantic predicate within LP. But regardless of how one tries to cope with the Truthmaker paradox, this paradox is surely interesting in its own right. However, its significance is completely orthogonal to the question of whether truthmaker maximalism is a philosophically sound view.

The aim of this study was to examine whether CM severity and type are associated with MDD-related brain alterations, and how they interact with sex and age. Methods Within the ENIGMA-MDD network, severity and subtypes of CM using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire were assessed and structural magnetic resonance imaging data from patients with MDD and healthy controls were analyzed in a mega-analysis comprising a total of 3872 participants aged between 13 and 89 years. Cortical thickness and surface area were extracted at each site using FreeSurfer. Results CM severity was associated with reduced cortical thickness in the banks of the superior temporal sulcus and supramarginal gyrus as well as with reduced surface area of the middle temporal lobe. Participants reporting both childhood neglect and abuse had a lower cortical thickness in the inferior parietal lobe, middle temporal lobe, and precuneus compared to participants not exposed to CM. In males only, regardless of diagnosis, CM severity was associated with higher cortical thickness of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, a significant interaction between CM and age in predicting thickness was seen across several prefrontal, temporal, and temporo-parietal regions. Conclusions Severity and type of CM may impact cortical thickness and surface area. Importantly, CM may influence age-dependent brain maturation, particularly in regions related to the default mode network, perception, and theory of mind.

J	Kress, H				Kress, Hartmut			The Legacy of Political Theology Carl Schmitt - Karl Barth - today's Connection Problems	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EVANGELISCHE ETHIK			German	Article								Currently, there is a renewed interest in political theology. Within the German Protestant tradition, this can be seen in the so-called public theology. In the 20th century, the classic pioneers of political theology were the lawyer Carl Schmitt and the Protestant dogmatist Karl Barth. Whilst C. Schmitt and K. Barth differed in their concrete political views they shared strong similarities in the key concepts and the patterns of argumentation that were structurally fundamental to their thinking. Both authors rejected modern liberal thinking. They found no access to liberal constitutional law, ideological pluralism or the freedom of conscience of the individual. The present essay explains the structural and conceptual parallels that exist between C. Schmitt and K. Barth. It also points out the continuous effects of their thinking. For this purpose, it mentions both the lawyer E.-W. Bockenforde and the theologian E. Jungel. Finally, the essay draws a conclusion that concerns political opinions found in today's theological thinking. These opinions are to be critically measured by the fact that they overcome the pre-modern ideas which were laid out in the political theology of C. Schmitt and K. Barth, for example their religious exaggeration of the state, their anti-liberalism and decisionism or their resistance against pluralism and against the right to self-determination as an individual human right.

Transcription-independent Induction of ERBB1 through Hypoxia-inducible Factor 2A Provides Cardioprotection during Ischemia and Reperfusion	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; EGF RECEPTOR; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ADENOSINE; AMPHIREGULIN; INJURY; MICE; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; PROTECTS	Background: During myocardial ischemia, hypoxia-inducible factors are stabilized and provide protection from ischemia and reperfusion injury. Recent studies show that myocyte-specific hypoxia-inducible factor 2A promotes myocardial ischemia tolerance through induction of epidermal growth factor, amphiregulin. Here, the authors hypothesized that hypoxia-inducible factor 2A may enhance epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (ERBB1) expression in the myocardium that could interface between growth factors and its effect on providing tolerance to ischemia and reperfusion injury. Methods: Human myocardial tissues were obtained from ischemic heart disease patients and normal control patients to compare ERBB1 expression. Myocyte-specific Hif2a or ErbB1 knockout mice were generated to observe the effect of Hif2a knockdown in regulating ERBB1 expression and to examine the role of ERBB1 during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. Results: Initial studies of myocardial tissues from patients with ischemic heart disease showed increased ERBB1 protein (1.12 +/- 0.24 vs. 13.01 +/- 2.20, P < 0.001). In contrast, ERBB1 transcript was unchanged. Studies using short hairpin RNA repression of Hif2A or Hif2a(loxP/loxP) Myosin Cre+ mice directly implicated hypoxia-inducible factor 2A in ERBB1 protein induction during hypoxia or after myocardial ischemia, respectively. Repression of RNA-binding protein 4 abolished hypoxia-inducible factor 2A-dependent induction of ERBB1 protein. Moreover, ErbB1(loxP/loxP) Myosin Cre+ mice experienced larger infarct sizes (22.46 +/- 4.06 vs. 46.14 +/- 1.81, P < 0.001) and could not be rescued via amphiregulin treatment. Conclusions: These findings suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor 2A promotes transcription-independent induction of ERBB1 protein and implicates epidermal growth factor signaling in protection from myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury.

Uncontrolled inflammatory host responses contribute to the unfavorable outcome by driving lung and extrapulmonary organ failure. The complement fragment C5a holds significant proinflammatory functions and is associated with tissue damage in various inflammatory conditions. The authors hypothesized that C5a concentrations are increased in pneumonia and C5a neutralization promotes barrier stabilization in the lung and is protective in pneumococcal pulmonary sepsis. Methods: The authors investigated regulation of C5a in pneumonia in a prospective patient cohort and in experimental pneumonia. Two complementary models of murine pneumococcal pneumonia were applied. Female mice were treated with NOX-D19, a C5a-neutralizing l-RNA-aptamer. Lung, liver, and kidney injury and the inflammatory response were assessed by measuring pulmonary permeability (primary outcome), pulmonary and blood leukocytes, cytokine concentrations in lung and blood, and bacterial load in lung, spleen, and blood, and performing histologic analyses of tissue damage, apoptosis, and fibrin deposition (n = 5 to 13). Results: In hospitalized patients with pneumonia (n = 395), higher serum C5a concentrations were observed compared to healthy subjects (n = 24; 6.3 nmol/l [3.9 to 10.0] vs. 4.5 nmol/l [3.8 to 6.6], median [25 to 75% interquartile range]; difference: 1.4 [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.9]; P = 0.029). Neutralization of C5a in mice resulted in lower pulmonary permeability in pneumococcal pneumonia (1.38 +/- 0.89 vs. 3.29 +/- 2.34, mean +/- SD; difference: 1.90 [95% CI, 0.15 to 3.66]; P = 0.035; n = 10 or 11) or combined severe pneumonia and mechanical ventilation (2.56 +/- 1.17 vs. 7.31 +/- 5.22; difference: 4.76 [95% CI, 1.22 to 8.30]; P = 0.011; n = 9 or 10). Further, C5a neutralization led to lower blood granulocyte colony-stimulating factor concentrations and protected against sepsis-associated liver injury. Conclusions: Systemic C5a is elevated in pneumonia patients. Neutralizing C5a protected against lung and liver injury in pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. Early neutralization of C5a might be a promising adjunctive treatment strategy to improve outcome in community-acquired pneumonia.

Low positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may promote lung collapse and intrapulmonary shunting, whereas high PEEP may increase dead space by inspiratory overdistension. The authors hypothesized that an electrical impedance tomography-guided PEEP approach minimizing tidal recruitment improves regional ventilation and perfusion matching when compared to a table-based low PEEP/no recruitment and an oxygenation-guided high PEEP/full recruitment strategy in a hybrid model of lung injury and elevated intraabdominal pressure. Methods: In 15 pigs with oleic acid-induced lung injury intraabdominal pressure was increased by intraabdominal saline infusion. PEEP was set in randomized order: (1) guided by a PEEP/inspired oxygen fraction table, without recruitment maneuver; (2) minimizing tidal recruitment guided by electrical impedance tomography after a recruitment maneuver; and (3) maximizing oxygenation after a recruitment maneuver. Single photon emission computed tomography was used to analyze regional ventilation, perfusion, and aeration. Primary outcome measures were differences in PEEP levels and regional ventilation/perfusion matching. Results: Resulting PEEP levels were different (mean +/- SD) with (1) table PEEP: 11 +/- 3 cm H2O; (2) minimal tidal recruitment PEEP: 22 +/- 3 cm H2O; and (3) maximal oxygenation PEEP: 25 +/- 4 cm H2O; P < 0.001. Table PEEP without recruitment maneuver caused highest lung collapse (28 +/- 11% vs. 5 +/- 5% vs. 4 +/- 4%; P < 0.001), shunt perfusion (3.2 +/- 0.8 l/min vs. 1.0 +/- 0.8 l/min vs. 0.7 +/- 0.6 l/min; P < 0.001) and dead space ventilation (2.9 +/- 1.0 l/min vs. 1.5 +/- 0.7 l/min vs. 1.7 +/- 0.8 l/min; P < 0.001). Although resulting in different PEEP levels, minimal tidal recruitment and maximal oxygenation PEEP, both following a recruitment maneuver, had similar effects on regional ventilation/perfusion matching. Conclusions: When compared to table PEEP without a recruitment maneuver, both minimal tidal recruitment PEEP and maximal oxygenation PEEP following a recruitment maneuver decreased shunting and dead space ventilation, and the effects of minimal tidal recruitment PEEP and maximal oxygenation PEEP were comparable.

This finding appears surprising from a development perspective, as the presence of a large number of donors, or more generally "fragmented aid," has been shown to negatively affect the recipient country. But fragmented aid can be beneficial: diversity among donors provides choice to the local actors involved in the process of democratization. It thus creates a "marketplace for idea support," which increases the viability of the resulting institutions. In contrast, a highly concentrated donor community can lead to the imposition of an institutional blueprint, designed in advance and not adapted to the needs of the recipient society. An instrumental variable analysis with panel data for 130 countries from 1994 to 2013, explicit tests of the causal mechanism, and anecdotal evidence from Ghana provide strong support for the benefits of diverse democracy aid.

Distribution of GOPs are considered as uniform and linearly graded through the thickness. Geometric imperfection is considered as first buckling mode shape of the beam, the GOP reinforced beam is rested in initial position. The material properties of GOP reinforced composite have been calculated via employment of Halpin-Tsai micromechanical scheme. The provided refined beam element verifies the shear deformation impacts needless of any shear correction coefficient. The post-buckling load-deflections relations have been calculated via solving the governing equations having cubic non-linearity implementing FEM. Obtained findings indicate the importance of GOP distributions, GOP weight fraction, matrix material, geometric imperfection, shear deformation and foundation parameters on nonlinear buckling behavior of GOP reinforced beam.

Prevalence and characteristics of apraxic deficits after left and right hemisphere stroke	FORTSCHRITTE DER NEUROLOGIE PSYCHIATRIE			German	Article						Apraxia; aphasia; stroke; Cologne Apraxia Screening	FACE APRAXIA; IMITATION; PANTOMIME; GESTURES; DAMAGE; TOOL	Investigations of apraxia typically focus on the role of the left hemisphere (LH), although apraxic deficits can also be observed after a right hemispheric (RH) stroke. We directly compared the prevalence and severity of apraxic deficits in patients with LH (n = 66) and RH (n = 73) stroke, after controlling for the effects of age and language performance. Apraxic deficits were assessed using the KAS (Cologne Apraxia Screening, including subscales for pantomiming and the imitation of bucco-facial and hand/arm gestures) as well as the Goldenberg Hand and Finger Imitation Test. Subsequently, we evaluated the effect of age, language performance, and hemisphere on the prevalence and characteristics of apraxic deficits by regression analyses and mixed design ANOVAS. For the imitation of hand positions, no significant difference was found between LH and RH stroke patients, when controlling for age and language performance. Consistent with the literature, RH stroke patients showed a poorer performance when imitating finger configurations. RH stroke patients also performed worse in the bucco-facial items of the KAS, particularly due to lower scores in upper-face gestures. For both patient groups, the language performance was related more to the pantomime than to the imitation subscales of the KAS. Data suggest that a comparable prevalence and severity of apraxic deficits can be found after LH and RH stroke when controlling for age and language abilities. As a consequence, an apraxic work-up should be included in the assessment of both LH and RH stroke patients prior to neurorehabilitation.	[Latarnik, S.; Wirth, K.; Held, A.; Kessler, J.; Fink, G.

J	Ernstmann, N; Heuser, C; Pfaff, H				Ernstmann, Nicole; Heuser, Christian; Pfaff, Holger			Health Services Research Facilities at German Universities	GESUNDHEITSWESEN			German	Article						Health services research; lecturer; teaching		Objectives So far, there is a lack of knowledge about the situation of health services research at German universities. The aim of the present study is to provide data about health services research facilities and teaching activity in German universities. Methods An online survey of German university lecturers in the field of health services research was conducted in 2017. The semi-standardized survey contained 25 factual questions. The quantitative responses were analyzed descriptively using IBM SPSS Statistics 24. The open questions were analyzed by content analysis. Results N = 42 lecturers took part in the survey (response rate 97.6 %). Health services research methods are subject to human medicine as well as health science programs. Specific programs in health services research were identified at 3 locations. The doctoral and postdoctoral opportunities in the field of health services research are heterogeneous. In the field of research methods, quantitative methods dominate, in particular patient-reported outcome research with primary data. The most frequently mentioned interdisciplinary cooperation is with biometry/epidemiology and health economics. Conclusion There is a need for further training for health services researchers in terms of specific terminology, framework models, data sources, evaluation methods, data protection aspects, and health policy aspects. In addition to the training of the health services researchers, it is important to improve the doctoral and habilitation opportunities in the field of health services research in order to encourage and support young scientists in health services research.

The need to exploit the available radio spectrum efficiently and providing new kinds of services render frequency syntonization insufficient. Phase and time-of-day synchronization will be necessary in the future. Thus, network operators are searching for efficient and reliable synchronization architectures. In this article, an example of such an architecture, applicable to fifth generation mobile networks, is presented, based on the requirements published in the latest ITU-T Recommendations. For supervision of the performance of the synchronization network, the technology of optical time transfer (OTT) is proposed, which allows dissemination of an accurate timescale such as a UTC realization to selected nodes of a coherent network primary reference time clock. The OTT realized so far and its current and future role in the network of Deutsche Telekom are discussed, and representative measurement results are shown.

Sequential Cluster Estimation: A Generalized Model for Finding Large Numbers of Clusters in Data	IEEE SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS MAGAZINE			English	Article						Solid modeling; Phase change materials; Estimation; Clustering algorithms; Data models; Fuzzy systems; Production		Clustering is an unsupervised learning method that partitions a set of objects into groups (clusters) of similar objects, where similarity is often computed from numerical object feature vectors (also called data points). An early (and still very popular) clustering algorithm, called k-means, finds clusters by minimizing the sum of the squared distances between data points and associated cluster centers. The k-means algorithm (like many other so-called hard clustering algorithms) assigns each object to one and only one of the considered clusters. In practice, however, cluster assignments may often be ambiguous. Objects may partially belong to several clusters or fit to none of these clusters. Such kinds of ambiguity can be mathematically handled by what is termed fuzzy set theory. A fuzzy variant of k-means called fuzzy c-means (FCM) has emerged to become one of the most popular fuzzy clustering methods, with hundreds of thousands of scientific publications. For a survey. Fuzzy clustering is often used to generate membership functions for fuzzy rule-based systems. Alternating cluster estimation (ACE)is an extension of FCM for arbitrary membership function shapes. This article introduces sequential cluster estimation (SCE), a variant of ACE that finds clusters sequentially and outperforms nonsequential clustering for data with many clusters.

In den letzten Jahren wurden Ausbruche in Kindertagesstatten und Kommunen beschrieben. Dennoch liegen zurzeit keine diagnostischen Algorithmen oder Therapieempfehlungen fur die entsprechenden Infektionen in Deutschland vor. MethodeEine Literaturrecherche in der Datenbank PubMed/MEDLINE erfolgte mit dem Ziel, einen diagnostischen und therapeutischen Algorithmus zu erarbeiten. Zudem wurden nationale und internationale Empfehlungen berucksichtigt. ErgebnissePanton-Valentine Leukozidin (PVL) ist ein porenbildendes Protein, das von bestimmten S. aureus-Stammen produziert wird. Sowohl Methicillin-sensible (MSSA) als auch Methicillin-resistente S. aureus (MRSA)-Stamme konnen das fur die PVL-Produktion verantwortliche Gen lukS-lukF besitzen. Das klinische Bild der durch einen PVL-positiven S. aureus verursachten Infektionen erstreckt sich von einzelnen rezidivierenden Abszessen bis hin zu einer ausgedehnten Furunkulose. Bei etwa 40 % der Patienten kommt es zu Rezidiven der Beschwerden trotz einer konsequenten Behandlung der Erstinfektion. Die Therapie variiert je nach klinischem Bild der jeweiligen Infektion. Zudem wird in der Literatur eine Screeninguntersuchung der Patienten und ihrer engen Kontaktpersonen sowie eine bakterielle Dekolonisation der Betroffenen empfohlen. SchlussfolgerungenDiese Arbeit fokussiert auf die Pathogenese und Risikofaktoren der rezidivierenden mukokutanen Infektionen durch PVL-positive S. aureus-Stamme und versucht einen diagnostischen und therapeutischen Algorithmus zur optimalen Patientenversorgung vorzuschlagen.

First licensed in 1998 in Germany, octanate (R) is approved in over 80 countries for the prevention and treatment of bleeding and for surgical prophylaxis in patients with haemophilia A, and in over 40 countries for immune tolerance induction (ITI). The manufacturing process for octanate (R) was developed to ensure high viral safety and effectively eliminates both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Over the past 20 years, the excellent safety and efficacy of octanate (R) have been demonstrated in pivotal clinical trials in adult and paediatric previously treated patients (PTPs) for on-demand treatment, prophylaxis and as surgical cover. Importantly, octanate (R) has displayed low immunogenicity in previously untreated patients (PUPs), with only 9.8% of PUPs developing FVIII inhibitors. octanate (R) has also shown to be highly effective in inhibitor elimination when used as ITI therapy. In a population of patients with high risk of ITI failure, success was achieved in 79.2% of patients (70.8% complete success), even when using exceptionally stringent success criteria. No relapses were observed. Here we present an overview of the clinical data with octanate (R) that support its use in a range of patient populations and clinical indications.

Cardiac arrhythmias in Dravet syndrome: an observational multicenter study	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; QT INTERVAL; CORRECTED QT; MOUSE MODEL; EPILEPSY; MORTALITY; LONG; DISPERSION; VARIANTS	Objectives We ascertained the prevalence of ictal arrhythmias to explain the high rate of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in Dravet syndrome (DS). Methods We selected cases with clinical DS, >= 6 years, SCN1A mutation, and >= 1 seizure/week. Home-based ECG recordings were performed for 20 days continuously. Cases were matched for age and sex to two epilepsy controls with no DS and >= 1 major motor seizure during video-EEG. We determined the prevalence of peri-ictal asystole, bradycardia, QTc changes, and effects of convulsive seizures (CS) on heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and PR/QRS. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for multiple seizures within subjects, seizure type, and sleep/wakefulness. Results We included 59 cases. Ictal recordings were obtained in 45 cases and compared to 90 controls. We analyzed 547 seizures in DS (300 CS) and 169 in controls (120 CS). No asystole occurred. Postictal bradycardia was more common in controls (n = 11, 6.5%) than cases (n = 4, 0.7%; P = 0.002). Peri-ictal QTc-lengthening (>= 60ms) occurred more frequently in DS (n = 64, 12%) than controls (n = 8, 4.7%, P = 0.048); pathologically prolonged QTc was rare (once in each group). In DS, interictal HRV was lower compared to controls (RMSSD P = 0.029); peri-ictal values did not differ between the groups. Prolonged QRS/PR was rare and more common in controls (QRS: one vs. none; PR: three vs. one). Interpretation We did not identify major arrhythmias in DS which can directly explain high SUDEP rates. Peri-ictal QTc-lengthening was, however, more common in DS. This may reflect unstable repolarization and an increased propensity for arrhythmias.	[Shmuely, Sharon; Helling, Robert M.; Gunning, W.

The observations were made in the framework of the AGN Polarization Key Science Program. The source was detected on projected space-ground baselines up to 70,833 km (5.6 Earth diameters) for both parallel-hand and cross-hand interferometric visibilities. We have used these detections to obtain a full-polarimetric image of the blazar at an unprecedented angular resolution of 24 mu as, the highest for this source to date. This enabled us to estimate the size of the radio core to be mu as and to reveal a complex structure and a significant curvature of the blazar jet in the inner 100 mu as, which is an indication that the jet viewing angle lies inside the opening angle of the jet conical outflow. Fairly highly (15%) linearly polarized emission is detected in a jet region 19 mu as in size, located 58 mu as downstream from the core. The highest brightness temperature in the source frame is estimated to be >2.2 x 10(13) K for the blazar core. This implies that the inverse-Compton limit must be violated in the rest frame of the source, even for the largest Doppler factor delta similar to 25 reported for 0716+714.

Many risk factors are shared between uveal melanoma and cutaneous melanoma, and these include fair skin color and light eye color. We carried out a genome-wide association study on 590 uveal melanoma patients and 5199 controls. Using a P-value limit of 10(-5) we identified 11 loci with related odds ratios for the risk alleles ranging from 1.32 to 1.78. The smallest P-value in the overall analysis reached 1.07 x 10(-7) for rs3759710 at 14q32.11, which is intronic to TDP1 (tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1). This locus emerged as a genome-wide significant association for uveal melanoma clinical subtypes with any chromosomal aberrations (P = 10(-10)) and presence of epithelioid cells (P = 10(-9)). TDP1 is a DNA repair enzyme capable of repairing many types of DNA damage, including oxidative DNA lesions which may be relevant for uveal melanoma. We additionally wanted to replicate the previous candidate locus for uveal melanoma at chromosome 5p15.33 intronic to the CLPTM1L gene. Our analysis gave an odds ratio of 1.23 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.38; P = 0.0008) for the C allele of rs421284 and 1.21 (95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.36; P = 0.002) for the C allele of rs452932. Our data thus replicated the association of uveal melanoma with the CLPTM1L locus. Our data on TDP1 offer an attractive model positing that oxidative damage in pigmented tissue may be an initiation event in uveal melanoma and the level of damage may be regulated by the degree and type of iris pigmentation.

This prey detection relies on mechanosensors, the integumentary sensory organs. We found by go/no go conditioning that C. niloticus and C. crocodilus can discriminate surface waves that differ in frequency. On average, frequency difference thresholds were about 4-5 %, e.g. C. niloticus and C. crocodilus distinguished a 40 Hz surface wave from a 38,5 Hz surface wave stimulus. C. niloticus and C. crocodilus also discriminated between single-frequency surface waves (15 Hz or 40 Hz) and surface waves that showed an abrupt frequency change (e.g. from 15 to 16.5 Hz or from 40 Hz to 38.5 Hz). The threshold for the abrupt frequency changes averaged 3-9 %. Additionally, Nile crocodiles differentiated also between a single-frequency water surface wave and a water surface wave that was amplitude modulated. C. niloticus also determined the direction (mean error angle between 13,7 and 16,6) to a surface wave stimulus. Furthermore, the distance covered by the Nile crocodiles increased slightly with increasing source distance. This was true whether a single-frequency (15 Hz or 40 Hz, relative distance error between 36 and 37%) or a multi-frequency (band width 1 80 Hz, relative distance error 25%) surface wave stimulus was offered. Even if the rewarded stimulus (40 Hz) was superimposed by an unrewarded surface wave some distance determination was observed (relative distance error between 30 and 62%).

The high dynamic range CO maps with a spectral resolution of 0.2 km s-1 display highly structured molecular cloud (MC) morphologies with valuable velocity information, revealing complex spatial and dynamical features of the local molecular gas. In combination with the MWISP CO data and the Gaia DR2, distances of the main MC structures in the local ISM are well determined toward the Aquila Rift region. We find that the total MC mass within 1 kpc is about.4.1.x.105 M. in the whole region. In fact, the mass of the molecular gas is dominated by the W40 giant molecular cloud (GMC) at 474 pc (1.4.x.105 M.) and the GMC complex G036.0+01.0 at 560-670 pc (2.0.x.105 M.), while the MCs at 220-260 pc have gas masses of 102 -103 M.. Interestingly, an 80 pc long filamentary MC G044.0-02.5 at a distance of 404 pc shows a systematic velocity gradient along and perpendicular to the major axis of the filament. The H I gas with enhanced emission has similar spatial morphologies and velocity features compared to the corresponding CO structure, indicating that large-scale converging H I flows are probably responsible for the formation of the MC. Meanwhile, the long filamentary MC consists of many sub-filaments with lengths ranging from 0.5 pc to several pc, as well as prevalent networks of filaments in other large-scale local MCs.

Although it has several advantages (suitable band gap around 2.4 eV, suitable valence-band position for water oxidation, low toxicity, high abundance), it suffers from slow charge-carrier transport properties, high surface recombination, and limited water-oxidation activity. In the present work, we review the synthesis and doping strategies that we developed in the last years to improve the PEC performance of BiVO4 photoanodes. Strategies ranging from single anion doping or cation doping to anion and cation co-doping will be presented for fluoride and molybdenum as anion and cation dopants, respectively.

These compounds have come into focus of research due to their possible application as photocatalyst material for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The theoretical background of state-of-the-art quantum-chemical approaches applied for predicting electronic and optical band gaps, absolute band positions, optical absorption spectra, dielectric functions and Raman spectra, is briefly reviewed. Recent applications of first-principles methods on magnetic and electronic properties of ferrites with M = Mg and the first row of subgroup elements Sc to Zn are presented, where it is shown that the fundamental band gap is strongly dependent on the spin state and the degree of inversion of the spinel structure. The observed variation of electronic properties may serve as an explanation for the large scattering of experimental results. The exchange of M and Fe cations has also a pronounced effect on the Raman spectra of ferrites, which is analyzed at atomic scale from first principles. Calculated optical absorption spectra of ferrites are compared to experimental spectra. The electronic nature of the first excitations and the role of oxygen vacancies are discussed. For the calculation of absolute band positions, which have a significant impact on the photoelectrochemical activity of the ferrites, models of the most stable ferrite surfaces are developed that take into account their polar nature and the interaction with the solvent. Theoretically predicted valence and conduction band edges are compared to results from electrochemical measurements. The role of cation exchange on the surface electronic structure is investigated both theoretically and experimentally.	[Ulpe, Anna C.; Bauerfeind, Katharina C.

Among various prevention strategies as suggested by WHO and others, hand hygiene has emerged as the most important public health preventive measure to control similar outbreaks in the past (SARS & MERS) also including the current COVID19 pandemic. The COVID19 pandemic provides a well-timed opportunity to stress the importance of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in the healthcare facilities (HCFs) and optimize infection prevention control across the globe. It also gives an opportunity to extend beyond conventional WASH and includes domains of biomedical waste management, Infection Prevention, and Control activities and also environmental hygiene. This perspective piece elaborates on the importance of optimal WASH and future scopes in HCFs during the post COVID19 pandemic era.

Pareto optimization of resonances and minimum-time control	JOURNAL DE MATHEMATIQUES PURES ET APPLIQUEES			English	Article						Optimal synthesis; Resonance free region; Euler-Lagrange equation for extremal scattering eigenfrequencies; High-Q photonic crystal	PHOTONIC CRYSTAL; SCATTERING RESONANCES; POTENTIAL WELL; EIGENVALUES; NANOCAVITY; MODES	The aim of the paper is to reduce one spectral optimization problem, which involves the minimization of the decay rate vertical bar Im kappa vertical bar of a resonance kappa, to a collection of optimal control problems on the Riemann sphere (C) over cap. This reduction allows us to apply methods of extremal synthesis to the structural optimization of layered optical cavities. We start from a dual problem of minimization of the resonator length and give several reformulations of this problem that involve Pareto optimization of the modulus vertical bar kappa vertical bar of a resonance, minimum-time control problems on (C) over cap, and associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Various types of controllability properties are studied in connection with the existence of optimizers and with the relationship between the Pareto optimal frontiers of minimal decay and minimal modulus. We give explicit examples of optimal resonances and describe qualitatively properties of the Pareto frontiers near them. A special representation of bang-bang controlled trajectories is combined with the analysis of extremals to obtain various bounds on optimal widths of layers. We propose a new method of computation of optimal symmetric resonators based on minimum-time control and compute with high accuracy several Pareto optimal frontiers and high-Q resonators.

In [13], for any (1+1)-dimensional scalar evolution equation epsilon, we defined a family of Lie algebras F(epsilon) which are responsible for all ZCRs of epsilon in the following sense. Representations of the algebras F(epsilon) classify all ZCRs of the equation epsilon up to local gauge transformations. In [12] we showed that, using these algebras, one obtains necessary conditions for existence of a Backlund transformation between two given equations. In this paper we show that, using the algebras F(epsilon), one obtains some necessary conditions for integrability of (1+1)-dimensional scalar evolution PDEs, where integrability is understood in the sense of soliton theory. Using these conditions, we prove non-integrability for some scalar evolution PDEs of order 5. Also, we prove a result announced in [13] on the structure of the algebras F(epsilon) for certain classes of equations of orders 3, 5, 7, which include KdV, mKdV, Kaup-Kupershmidt, Sawada-Kotera type equations. Among the obtained algebras for equations considered in this paper and in [12], one finds infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of certain polynomial matrix-valued functions on affine algebraic curves of genus 1 and 0.

GOP distributions are considered as uniform and linear models. Utilizing a shear deformable plate model having five field components, it is feasible to verify transverse shear impacts with no inclusion of correction factor. The nonlinear governing equations have been solved via an analytical trend for deriving post-buckling load-deflection relations of the GOP-reinforced plate. Derived findings demonstrate the significance of GOP distributions, geometric imperfectness, foundation factors, material compositions and geometrical factors on post-buckling properties of reinforced concrete plates.

Although interventional treatment options have rapidly improved in recent years, symptomatic aortic valve stenosis is still associated with high morbidity and mortality. Calcific aortic valve stenosis is characterized by a progressive fibro-calcific remodeling and thickening of the aortic valve cusps, which subsequently leads to valve obstruction. The underlying pathophysiology is complex and involves endothelial dysfunction, immune cell infiltration, myofibroblastic and osteoblastic differentiation, and, subsequently, calcification. To date, no pharmacotherapy has been established to prevent aortic valve calcification. However, novel promising therapeutic targets have been recently identified. This review summarizes the current knowledge of pathomechanisms involved in aortic valve calcification and points out novel treatment strategies.

Dissolution kinetics of trapped air in a spherical void: Modeling the long-term saturation of cementitious materials	CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH			English	Article						Kinetics; Transport properties; Modeling	EPSTEIN-PLESSET MODEL; WATER-ABSORPTION; POROUS-MEDIA; GAS; CONCRETE	The saturation of air-entrained cementitious materials governs their resistance to freeze-thaw cycles. Upon immersion in water, water is sucked in the capillary porosity and part of the air initially present is trapped. This trapped air slowly dissolves and diffuses outward, leading to a slowly increasing saturation. Building on efforts in fields ranging from gas-liquid interfaces to multi-phase transport and cement sciences, a model is derived to describe the governing physics behind the long-term saturation rate in immersed cementitious materials due to the dissolution and diffusion of trapped gaseous air in a spherical air void. We model how liquid water continuously enters a single air void and how various material properties influence the time to complete dissolution of air trapped in the spherical void. The relative influence of advection, diffusion, and various materials properties are studied and the model results are found to agree with imaging studies and theoretical models.

No genetic markers for resistance to individual antiseizure medication (ASM) have yet been identified. We aimed to identify the role of rare genetic variants in drug resistance for three common ASMs: levetiracetam (LEV), lamotrigine (LTG), and valproic acid (VPA). Methods A cohort of 1622 individuals of European descent with epilepsy was deeply phenotyped and underwent whole exome sequencing (WES), comprising 575 taking LEV, 826 LTG, and 782 VPA. We performed gene- and gene set-based collapsing analyses comparing responders and nonresponders to the three drugs to determine the burden of different categories of rare genetic variants. Results We observed a marginally significant enrichment of rare missense, truncating, and splice region variants in individuals who were resistant to VPA compared to VPA responders for genes involved in VPA pharmacokinetics. We also found a borderline significant enrichment of truncating and splice region variants in the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein (SV2) gene family in nonresponders compared to responders to LEV. We did not see any significant enrichment using a gene-based approach. Significance In our pharmacogenetic study, we identified a slightly increased burden of damaging variants in gene groups related to drug kinetics or targeting in individuals presenting with drug resistance to VPA or LEV. Such variants could thus determine a genetic contribution to drug resistance.

Accurate compound-specific C-14 dating of archaeological pottery vessels	NATURE			English	Article							RADIOCARBON; CALIBRATION; CARBON	Pottery is one of the most commonly recovered artefacts from archaeological sites. Despite more than a century of relative dating based on typology and seriation(1), accurate dating of pottery using the radiocarbon dating method has proven extremely challenging owing to the limited survival of organic temper and unreliability of visible residues(2-4). Here we report a method to directly date archaeological pottery based on accelerator mass spectrometry analysis of C-14 in absorbed food residues using palmitic (C-16:0) and stearic (C-18:0) fatty acids purified by preparative gas chromatography(5-8). We present accurate compound-specific radiocarbon determinations of lipids extracted from pottery vessels, which were rigorously evaluated by comparison with dendrochronological dates(9,10) and inclusion in site and regional chronologies that contained previously determined radiocarbon dates on other materials(11-15). Notably, the compound-specific dates from each of the C-16:0 and C-18:0 fatty acids in pottery vessels provide an internal quality control of the results(6) and are entirely compatible with dates for other commonly dated materials. Accurate radiocarbon dating of pottery vessels can reveal: (1) the period of use of pottery; (2) the antiquity of organic residues, including when specific foodstuffs were exploited; (3) the chronology of sites in the absence of traditionally datable materials; and (4) direct verification of pottery typochronologies. Here we used the method to date the exploitation of dairy and carcass products in Neolithic vessels from Britain, Anatolia, central and western Europe, and Saharan Africa. Using lipid residues absorbed in potsherds, the ages of pottery from various archaeological sites are determined and validated using sites for which the dates are well known from other methods.

J	Magsig, BO				Magsig, Bjorn-Oliver			Water security: A litmus test for international law	REVIEW OF EUROPEAN COMPARATIVE & INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW			English	Article							HIMALAYAN ASIA; MIGRATION; CLIMATE; REGIME	While water security is now being discussed at the highest political level, the debate on how the concept should actually be implemented to improve the management of our transboundary freshwater resources is still in its infancy. Further, the absence of law in much of this debate impedes efforts to utilize water security as a change agent for international water law and diplomacy - an unsatisfactory situation threatening global stability and international security. This article demonstrates that a fresh conceptualization of water security is not only required to bring about the desperately needed change in the underlying perceptions of sovereignty, but that it is also possible. However, this will only work if international law plays its part in turning the buzzword into a meaningful concept. By supporting the contemporary understanding of water security through strengthening normative developments regarding the concepts of common concern and cooperative sovereignty, these concepts of international law could simultaneously be better employed to tackle other increasingly complex global challenges.

J	Mukhopadhyay, S				Mukhopadhyay, Sankar			Language assimilation and performance in achievement tests among Hispanic children in the US: Evidence from a field experiment	ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						Immigrants; Language assimilation; Test score; Education; Children	ENGLISH; EARNINGS; AGE; ACQUISITION; PROFICIENCY; LEARNERS	We provide new evidence about the effect of testing language on test scores using data from two rounds (conducted approximately six years apart) of the New Immigrants Survey. In each round, U.S.-born and foreign-born children of Hispanic origin were randomly assigned to take the Woodcock-Johnson achievement (two reading and two math) tests, either in Spanish or in English. U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants perform better in reading tests (but not in math tests) when they are assigned to take tests in English. The size of the testing-language effect remains stable across rounds. Foreign-born children of Hispanic immigrants perform better in both reading and math tests when they are assigned to take tests in Spanish in the first round. However, the size of the testing-language effect declines in reading tests and completely disappears in math tests by the second round. Our results suggest that the depreciation of Spanish skills is an essential factor (and, in some cases, more important than the accumulation of English skills) in explaining the decline in the testing-language effect among foreign-born children. We also explore how age at immigration and years spent in the U.S. affect language assimilation.

ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						Student employment; Signalling; Hiring chances; Vignette study	FACTORIAL SURVEY; WORK EXPERIENCE; EMPLOYMENT; EDUCATION; DISCRIMINATION; UNIVERSITY; VIGNETTE; OUTCOMES; RETURNS	Due to the prevalence and important consequences of student work, the topic has seen an increased interest in the literature. However, to date the focus has been solely on measuring the effect of student employment on later labour market outcomes, relying on signalling theory to explain the observed effects. In the current study, we go beyond measuring the effect of student work and we examine for the first time what exactly is being signalled by student employment. We do this by means of a vignette experiment in which we ask 242 employers to evaluate a set of five fictitious profiles. Whereas all types of student work signal a better work attitude, a larger social network, a greater sense of responsibility, an increased motivation, and more maturity, only student employment in line with a job candidate's field of study is a signal of increased human capital and increased trainability.

Economic theory regards money as a crude arrangement for monitoring counterparts' past conduct. If so, then a public record of past actions-or memory-should supersede the function performed by money. This intriguing theoretical postulate remains untested. In an experiment, we show that the suggested functional equivalence between money and memory does not translate into an empirical equivalence: money removed the incentives to free ride, while memory did not. Monetary systems performed a richer set of functions than just revealing past behaviors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We tested our hypotheses in a triangular multisource design in two complementary studies comprised of both target workers and coworkers with a total of N = 1438 participants. In Study 1, we found that when political skill was high, targets received high career role performance ratings from coworkers, and this was also the case when targets had high levels of Machiavellianism (socioanalytic masking effect). For targets with low political skill, the career role performance ratings of high Machiavellians was low at long tenure. The results of Study 2 partly disconfirmed mimicry-deception theory: Individuals high in Machiavellianism and high in political skill did not tend to avoid engaging in overtly mean behaviors toward others and extracting organizational resources at short tenure. Implications and limitations are discussed.

Time equals money?: A randomized controlled field experiment on the effects of four types of training vouchers on training participation	JOURNAL OF VOCATIONAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Training voucher; Training participation; Conservation of Resources; Reasoned Action Approach; Employability; Working time; Monetary budget; Flexibility	SELF-EFFICACY; MEDIATING ROLE; JOB RESOURCES; WORK; CONSERVATION; MOTIVATION; IMPACT; CAREER; EMPLOYABILITY; EDUCATION	Organizations aiming to help their employees in fostering their human capital offer training, but not all employees participate. Some organizations therefore experiment with training vouchers that typically offer financial means for training to motivate training participation. However, the effectiveness of such vouchers remains suboptimal, arguably due to lack of clarity on- and variation in the mechanisms of such vouchers. The present paper uniquely employs Conservation of Resources theory to compare the effectiveness of four types of vouchers with different combinations of money and time as well as different (i.e. firm internal and external) governance on training participation. To this end, 230 employees in a large Dutch insurance company were randomly assigned to one of the four voucher types or a control group. For eleven months, training participation was monitored and a concurrent questionnaire measured several personal characteristics as potential covariates and moderators. We find that the voucher type that allows employees to freely choose between a training budget and training days most strongly encourages training participation. Vouchers that provide employees with either working days or a training budget did not improve training participation significantly compared to the control group. Moreover, moderation analyses suggested that the training participation of employees provided with non-flexible vouchers appears to depend more strongly on personal characteristics, and particularly components from the Reasoned Action Approach. These findings suggest that to encourage training participation organizations should best offer flexible vouchers that provide employees a free choice between money and working time to spend on training. Moreover, the findings demonstrate the applicability of Conservation of Resource theory to training vouchers and address the need for recognizing subjectivity within this theoretical framework.

J	Joricke, B				Joericke, Burglind			Fundamental groups, 3-braids, and effective estimates of invariants	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						Fundamental group; Entropy; Extremal length; Conformal module; 3-braids		We define invariants of braids rather than invariants of conjugacy classes of braids. For any pure 3-braid we give effective upper and lower bounds for these invariants. This is done in terms of a natural syllable decomposition of the word representing the image of the braid in the braid group modulo its center. The bounds differ by a multiplicative constant not depending on the word. Respective bounds are given for all 3-braids. We also obtain effective upper and lower bounds for the entropy of pure 3-braids in these terms. The proof leads to the study of the extremal length (in the sense of Ahlfors) of classes of curves representing elements of the fundamental group of the twice punctured complex plane.

J	Ponsinet, G				Ponsinet, Gautier			On the structure of signed Selmer groups	MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						Iwasawa theory; Supersingular primes; Abelian varieties	P-ADIC REPRESENTATIONS; IWASAWA THEORY; ELLIPTIC-CURVES; INVARIANTS	Let F be a number field unramified at an odd prime p and F infinity be the Zp-cyclotomic extension of F. Generalizing Kobayashi plus/minus Selmer groups for elliptic curves, Buyukboduk and Lei have defined modified Selmer groups, called signed Selmer groups, for certain non-ordinary Gal(F/F)-representations. In particular, their construction applies to abelian varieties defined over F with good supersingular reduction at primes of F dividing p. Assuming that these Selmer groups are cotorsion Zp[[Gal(F infinity/F)]]-modules, we show that they have no proper sub-Zp[[Gal(F infinity/F)]]-module of finite index. We deduce from this a number of arithmetic applications. On studying the Euler-Poincare characteristic of these Selmer groups, we obtain an explicit formula on the size of the Bloch-Kato Selmer group attached to these representations. Furthermore, for two such representations that are isomorphic modulo p, we compare the Iwasawa-invariants of their signed Selmer groups.

To date, no studies have assessed the long-term real-world effectiveness and safety of fingolimod following a switch from natalizumab. We aimed to investigate the benefit-risk profile of fingolimod over 48 months in patients switching from natalizumab, and the impact of washout duration after natalizumab discontinuation on outcomes during fingolimod treatment. Methods: This analysis used data from PANGAEA, an ongoing German multicenter, prospective, non-interventional, observational study. In total, 3912 patients were included: 530 had switched from natalizumab (natalizumab subpopulation), and a reference population of 3382 had switched from other treatments or were treatment-naive (non-natalizumab subpopulation). The natalizumab subpopulation was stratified by washout duration (30-89 days, 90-149 days, and >= 150 days) prior to fingolimod initiation. Results: In the natalizumab subpopulation over 48 months of fingolimod treatment, 58.2% (n = 227/390) of patients remained on fingolimod. Over this period, mean annualized relapse rates (ARRs) and proportions of patients who relapsed were similar across washout durations, and ranged from 0.455 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.363-0.571) to 0.546 (95% CI: 0.446-0.669) and 54.1% (n = 92/170) to 60.2% (n = 127/211), respectively. Overall, 17.1% (n = 36/211) had 6-month confirmed disability worsening. In the non-natalizumab subpopulation, ARR was 0.300, 40.9% (n = 1325/3237) of patients relapsed, and a similar proportion to the natalizumab subpopulation had 6-month disability worsening (16.6% [n = 232/1394]). In both subpopulations, the safety profile of fingolimod was consistent with that observed in randomized controlled trials. Conclusions: In patients discontinuing natalizumab, fingolimod has a favorable benefit-risk profile over 48 months. These findings also suggest using a short washout following natalizumab discontinuation, consistent with guidelines and current clinical practice in Germany.

Here, the prevalence of preoperative and postoperative anaemia as well as their effects on transfusion rate, hospital length of stay and hospital mortality in primary hip and knee arthroplasty has been analysed. Methods From January 2012 to September 2018, 378,069 adult inpatients from 13 German hospitals were analysed on the basis of an anonymized registry. Of these, n=10,017 patients had a hip and knee joint primary arthroplasty. The primary endpoint was the incidence of preoperative anaemia, which was analysed by the first available preoperative haemoglobin value according to the WHO definition. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital length of stay, number of patients with red blood cell concentrate transfusion, incidence of hospital-acquired anaemia, number of deceased patients, and postoperative complications. Results The preoperative anaemia rate was 14.8% for elective knee joint arthroplasty, 22.9% for elective hip joint arthroplasty and 45.0% for duo-prosthesis implantation. Preoperative anaemia led to a significantly higher transfusion rate (knee: 8.3 vs. 1.8%; hip: 34.5 vs. 8.1%; duo-prosthesis: 42.3 vs. 17.4%), an increased red blood cell concentrate consumption (knee: 256107 vs. 295 RBC/1000 patients; hip: 92960 vs. 19016 RBC/1000 patients; duo-prosthesis: 141198 vs. 453 +/- 42 RBC/1000 patients). Pre-operative anaemia was associated with prolonged hospital stay (12.0 [10.0; 17.0] d vs. 11.0 [9.0; 13.0] d; p<0.001) and increased mortality (5.5% [4.6-6.5%] vs. 0.9% [0.7-1.2%]; Fisher p<0.001) compared to non-anaemic patients. In patients aged 80 years and older, the incidence of preoperative anaemia and thus the transfusion rate was almost twice as high as in patients under 80 years of age. Summary Preoperative anaemia is common in knee and hip primary arthroplasty and was associated with a relevant increase in red blood cell concentrate consumption. In the context of patient blood management, a relevant potential arises, especially in elective orthopaedic surgery, to better prepare elective patients, to avoid unnecessary transfusions and thus to conserve the valuable resource blood. Zusammenfassung Einleitung Praoperativ liegt bei etwa jedem 3.Patienten eine nicht therapierte Anamie vor, die wiederum im Kontext eines chirurgischen Eingriffs mit einem erhohten Transfusionsbedarf von allogenen Erythrozytenkonzentraten (EK) sowie Komplikationen einhergeht. In der vorliegenden Arbeit soll die Pravalenz einer pra- und postoperativen Anamie und deren Einfluss auf den Transfusionsbedarf von EK, Krankenhausverweildauer sowie Krankenhaussterblichkeit in der primaren Huft- und Kniegelenkendoprothetik analysiert werden. Methoden Basierend auf einem anonymisierten Register wurden von Januar 2012 bis September 2018 378069 erwachsene stationare Patienten aus 13 deutschen Krankenhausern analysiert, von denen n=10017 Patienten eine Huft- und Kniegelenkprimarimplantation hatten. Der primare Endpunkt war die Inzidenz einer praoperativen Anamie, die uber den 1. praoperativ verfugbaren Hamoglobinwert entsprechend der WHO-Definition analysiert wurde. Zu den sekundaren Endpunkten zahlte die Krankenhausverweildauer, Anzahl Patienten mit EK-Transfusion, Inzidenz einer postoperativen krankenhauserworbenen Anamie, Anzahl verstorbener Patienten sowie verschiedene postoperative Komplikationen. Ergebnisse Die praoperative Anamierate betrug bei elektiver Kniegelenkendoprothetik 14,8%, bei elektiver Huftgelenkendoprothetik 22,9% und bei Duokopfprothesenimplantation sogar 45,0%. Eine praoperative Anamie fuhrte zu einer signifikant hoheren EK-Transfusionsrate (Kniegelenkprothese: 8,3 vs. 1,8%; Huftgelenksprothese: 34,5 vs. 8,1%; Duokopfprothese: 42,3 vs. 17,4%) sowie einem erhohten EK-Verbrauch (Kniegelenk: 256 +/- 107 vs. 29 +/- 5 EK/1000 Patienten; Huftgelenk: 929 +/- 60 vs. 190 +/- 16 EK/1000 Patienten; Duokopfprothese: 1411 +/- 98 vs. 453 +/- 42). Im Gesamtkollektiv war eine praoperative Anamie gegenuber nicht anamischen Patienten mit einer verlangerten Krankenhausverweildauer (12,0 [10,0; 17,0] d vs. 11,0 [9,0; 13,0] d; p<0,001) sowie einer erhohten Sterblichkeit assoziiert (5,5% [4,6-6,5%] vs. 0,9% [0,7%-1,2%]; Fisher p<0,001). Bei Patienten mit einem Alter von 80 Jahren und hoher war die Inzidenz einer praoperativen Anamie und damit die Transfusionsrate nahezu doppelt so hoch wie bei den unter 80-Jahrigen. Zusammenfassung Eine praoperative Anamie kommt bei Knie- und Huftgelenkprimarimplantation haufig vor und ist mit einem relevant erhohten EK-Verbrauch assoziiert. Vor diesem Hintergrund konnte sich in der Zukunft vor allem in der elektiven orthopadischen Chirurgie ein relevantes Potenzial ergeben, im Sinne von Patient Blood Management die elektiven Patienten besser vorzubereiten, um unnotige Transfusionen zu vermeiden und so die wertvolle Ressource Blut zu schonen.

To assess the postoperative outcome, multiple scoring systems like the DASH, MEPS und Morrey Score have been described. The goal of this paper is to compare the subjective elbow value (SEV) to these commonly used scoring systems. We hypothesized that the SEV would have a high correlation and practicability for the evaluation of elbow function after isolated olecranon injury. Patients and Methods Clinical data of 40 patients were collected and retrospectively analysed. All patients suffered an isolated olecranon fracture and were surgically treated by tension band wiring or plate fixation. In the follow-up examinations the Mayo Score, DASH Score, Morrey Score and SEV were measured for correlation purposes. Results The mean follow-up time was 70.545.6 months. The median DASH Score was 9.9 (4.1-20.4) and 100 (85-100) for the MEPS. The median Morrey Score was 98 (92-100). The median SEV was 90% (80-95%). The Pearson correlation between the DASH and SEV was -0.85 and 0.80 between the MEPS and the SEV. Conclusions The SEV shows a high correlation to the most commonly used scoring systems for outcome evaluation after elbow injury. It is easy to use and can be seen as a valuable tool to assess patients after olecranon fractures. Zusammenfassung Hintergrund Olekranonfrakturen sind haufige Verletzungen bei Patienten aller Altersgruppen. Fur die Beurteilung des postoperativen Ergebnisses werden in der Literatur verschiedene, teils komplexe Scoring-Systeme beschrieben wie DASH-Score, MEPS und Morrey-Score. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist ein Vergleich der subjektiven Ellenbogenfunktion (SEF) mit gangigen Scoring-Systemen unter der Hypothese einer hohen Korrelation und der praktikablen klinischen Anwendung der SEF. Patienten und Methoden Klinische Daten von 40 Patienten nach operativer Versorgung von Olekranonfrakturen wurden erhoben und retrospektiv ausgewertet. Die Patienten wurden zwischen 2010 und 2017 mittels Plattenosteosynthese oder Zuggurtungsosteosynthese operativ therapiert. In der klinischen und funktionellen Nachuntersuchung wurden der Mayo-, DASH-, Morrey-Score sowie die subjektive Ellenbogenfunktion erfasst und die Pearson-Korrelation fur alle moglichen Kombinationen der Scores berechnet. Ergebnisse Der mittlere Nachuntersuchungszeitraum lag bei 70,5 +/- 45,6 Monaten. Der Median des DASH-Scores lag bei 9,9 (4,1-20,4) und bei 100 (85-100) fur den MEPS. Der Median des Morrey-Scores betrug 98 (92-100). Der Median der subjektiven Ellenbogenfunktion betrug 90% (80-95%). Die Pearson-Korrelation zwischen dem DASH und der SEF lag bei -0,85 und zwischen dem MEPS und der SEF bei 0,80. Schlussfolgerung Die SEF zeigt eine hohe Korrelation mit den beiden am meisten verwendeten Scoring-Systemen. In der klinischen Praxis ist die Anwendung und Dokumentation der SEF daher als ein wertvoller Parameter in der Qualitats- und Verlaufskontrolle nach operativ versorgter Olekranonfraktur anzusehen.

J	Zanella, F				Zanella, Francesco			Defining Identity through Divine Retribution in Tannaitic Judaism	REVIEW OF RABBINIC JUDAISM			English	Article						divine retribution; Tannaitic Judaism; Jewish identity; reward; punishment		This essay deals with the notion of divine retribution in Tannaitic literature. It argues that this concept can be used to establish traditions and create identity. After introductory remarks on the different Tannaitic perspectives on divine retribution, the paper focuses on the main features of the Tannaitic idea of divine retribution, exploring the key questions: Why and when does God punish? Why and when does God bestow a reward? Who is supposed to be rewarded, and why? Who will be punished, and why? It then deals with the different uses the Tannaim made of the concept of retribution.

Rapid titration protocol - Experiences with a dynamic novel titration regime for vagus nerve stimulation in a group of depressive patients	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Vagus nerve; Therapy-resistant depression; Vagus nerve stimulation; VNS; TRD; Dosing		Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an established tool in the psychiatric armamentarium for patients with therapy-resistant depression (TRD) with response rates of approximately 60%. So far, VNS is titrated slowly during ambulatory in-office visits. Thus, antidepressive effects can be expected after approximately six months. We report our experiences with a rapid dosing regime (RDR) with titration start shortly after VNS-implantation. We retrospectively analysed data of six patients with TRD who received VNS. Stimulation parameters were evaluated with regard to clinical side effects, heart rates (HR) and blood pressures (BP). Depressive symptoms were measured by Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) one week before and three months after implantation of the VNS. All patients received first stimulation between one and four days after surgery. We elevated output current using 0.25 mA titration steps. We increased output current between one and four days after the last titration. All patients received 1.0 mA output current after eight to 14 days post-surgery. HR and BP remained stable in all patients. All side effects were mild and temporary. MADRS scores were significantly lower three months after VNS-implantation (24 +/- 8) than one week before VNS-implantation (42 +/- 4; p = 0.028). The therapeutic range of VNS-parameters for antidepressive effect was reached quicker without finding increased numbers of side effects. Consequently, by using RDR the antidepressive effect of VNS-therapy for patients with TRD could be reached earlier than using slow titration. Our presented RDR might be able to significantly shorten the "clinical effect gap" due to the neurobiological and titration-related latency. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of austerity measures on the public - private sector wage gap in Europe	LABOUR ECONOMICS			English	Article						Europe; Crises; Public - private sector wage gap; Quantiles; Decompositions	PANEL-DATA; DECOMPOSITION; DISCRIMINATION; EMPLOYMENT; PREMIUM	Considering the year prior to the international and sovereign crises (2007) as a benchmark and studying all years until the crises receded (2013) in most of the 31 countries available in the European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC), we examine the impact of public sector pay reforms on the public-private sector wage gap. We do so at the mean and along quantiles of the wage distributions, using decomposition methods to identify the explained and unexplained components of the gap. We code the pay reforms in the 31 countries into the categorical variables Freeze and Cut and consider their impact on quantile features of the wage gap using static and dynamic panel methods. Robust estimates suggest that public sector freezes and/or cuts had negative and statistically significant effects on the unexplained public-private sector gap, particularly evident at the median and the 90th quantile. At the 10th quantile, the impact of the measures was positive but statistically weaker. The 90th minus 10th quantile effects are negative, reflecting attempts by many countries to protect the low-paid, regardless of the initial public-private pay gap for this group. Countries which received external financial assistance had high pay gaps before the crises and displayed a variety of adjustments during the crises.

The toxic career model explains how dark personalities successfully climb the organizational ladder. It suggests that dark personalities can get ahead at work via self- and other-rated political skill, which results in improved job performance ratings by supervisors. We extended this mediation model by adding targets' hierarchical organizational position. Additionally, we specified two moderating conditions that can explain how individuals with low and high honesty-humility can get ahead. First, enterprising job characteristics facilitate higher self-other agreement regarding political skill, thereby promoting the rise of individuals low in honesty-humility. Second, high honesty-humility compensates for low other-perceived political skill. We successfully tested the moderated-mediation hypotheses from the extended toxic career model in a multi-source design with 203 target-peer-supervisor triplets.

Methods Longitudinal data (n = 1,272) were taken from a multicenter prospective cohort study ("Study on Needs, health service use, costs and health-related quality of life in a large sample of oldest-old primary care patients (85+)" [AgeQualiDe]). Functional decline was assessed using the Lawton and Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. Results While initial increases in depressive symptoms were associated with subsequent increases in functional impairment, initial increases in functional impairment were not associated with subsequent increases in depressive symptoms. Conclusions Our results stress the relevance of increases in depressive symptoms for upcoming functional decline among the oldest old. Further longitudinal studies are required to replicate our findings.

The Sting of Rejection: Deferring Blood Donors due to Low Hemoglobin Values Reduces Future Returns	TRANSFUSION MEDICINE AND HEMOTHERAPY			English	Article						Blood donation; Donor deferral; Donor return; Quasi-experiment	MOTIVATION; DONATIONS; DEVICE	Background: Roughly one quarter of short-term temporary deferrals (STTD) of blood donors are low-hemoglobin deferrals (LHD), i.e. STTD due to a hemoglobin (Hb) value falling below a cutoff of 125 g/L for female and 135 g/L for male donors. Since voluntarily donating blood is a prosocial activity, donors may perceive deferral as social exclusion, which can cause social pain, decrease self-esteem, and lead to antisocial behavior. However, little is known about the causal impacts of LHD on donor return. Study Design and Methods: We conducted a quasi-experiment with 80,060 donors invited to blood drives in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, between 2009 and 2014. Within a narrow window of Hb values around the predetermined cutoff, the rate of LHD jumps discontinuously. This discontinuous jump allows us to quantify the causal effects of LHD on donor return, as it is uncorrelated with other unobserved factors that may also affect donor return. Results: We found different behavioral reactions to LHD for female and male donors. Female donors do not react to the first LHD. However, after any repeated LHD, they are 13.53 percentage points (p <0.001) less likely to make at least 1 donation attempt within the next 18 months and make 0.389 fewer donation attempts (p <0.001). Male donors react to the first LHD. They are 5.32 percentage points (p = 0.139) less likely to make at least 1 donation attempt over the next 18 months and make 0.227 (p = 0.018) fewer donation attempts. After any repeated LHD, male donors are 13.30 percentage points (p = 0.004) less likely to make at least 1 donation attempt and make 0.152 (p = 0.308) fewer donation attempts. Conclusion: LHD have detrimental impacts on donor return, especially if they occur repeatedly - suggesting that avoiding false LHD and helping donors to better cope with them helps to maintain the pool of prospective donors.

It employs upscaling ideas to coarsen the respective linear system and provides a high amount of inherent parallelism. However, it has the drawback that it can so far only be applied to scalar problems, e.g., a pressure sub-problem. Moreover, AMS relies on the availability of information on the physics and the grid to construct a two-level scheme. Generalizing the AMS approach to overcome these limitations requires substantial efforts and is not straightforward. To exploit the benefits of AMS, however, we integrate its core ideas in an algebraic multigrid (AMG) method. Thus, all results and techniques from the well-established AMG are directly available in conjunction with (core ingredients of) AMS. This holds regarding multilevel usage as well as the independence of geometric and physical information. But it also holds for the System-AMG approach that allows us to consider additional thermal and mechanical unknowns.

Therefore, international HF guidelines give highest evidence and recommendation on their clinical usage, particular in patients with dyspnea. Key message of this review is to inform about the concept of sequential NP measurements as quantifiable plasma biomarker to objectify sodium-water-dynamics and clinical therapy response during recompensation of HF patients. Essentially, three clinical scenarios result of sequential NP measurements and might have a valuable role in HF risk stratification, prognosis and need of therapy optimization of in- and outpatient care.

Materials and Methods A total of 40 patients who had undergone renal magnetic resonance imaging were included in this retrospective analysis of a prospectively planned cohort study. All examinations were performed on a 3 T whole-body magnetic resonance system. Both s-DWI and SMS-RT-DWI were obtained and images were independently reviewed by 2 radiologists on a 5-point Likert scale with respect to overall preference and image quality, renal edge and parenchymal sharpness, cortico-medullary differentiation, and sequence-related artifacts. Furthermore, discernibility of renal lesions was assessed. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured from SNR maps. The derived mean apparent diffusion coefficients were also compared. Qualitative parameters were assessed with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and quantitative parameters, with the Student t test. Results Overall image quality, renal edge, and parenchymal sharpness of SMS-RT-DWI were rated as superior to s-DWI by the readers, with fewer sequence-related artifacts (P < 0.01 for all). Lesion discernibility was significantly improved for SMS-RT-DWI (P < 0.01). Both readers preferred SMS-RT-DWI to s-DWI in all cases (40/40). The acquisition time for SMS-RT-DWI was 30% shorter than for s-DWI. Mean SNR heterogeneity of SMS-RT-DWI at b = 800 s/mm(2) was statistically significantly lower than s-DWI, whereas mean SNR was significantly higher for SMS-RT-DWI. Mean apparent diffusion coefficient values from both sequences were comparably homogeneous throughout the kidneys. Conclusion Simultaneous multislice DWI of the kidney at 3 T with respiratory triggering yields substantially improved image quality and lesion discernibility compared with standard single-shot echoplanar DWI with a 30% reduction in scan acquisition time.

Evaluation of a portable nanopore-based sequencer for detection of viruses in water	JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						MinION (TM); Seeded well water; MS2; PhiX174; DNA and RNA workflows	NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCE; CHINESE PATIENTS; REAL-TIME; MINION; IDENTIFICATION; DIVERSITY	The newly emerged nanopore sequencing technology such as MinION (TM) allows for real-time detection of long DNA/RNA fragments on a portable device, yet few have examined its performance for environmental viromes. Here we seeded one RNA virus bacteriophage MS2 and one DNA virus bacteriophage PhiX174 into 10 L well water at three levels ranging from 1 to 21,100 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. Two workflows were established to maximize the number of sequencing reads of RNA and DNA viruses using MinION (TM). With dead-end ultra-filtration, PEG precipitation, and random amplification, MinION (TM) was capable of detecting MS2 at 155 PFU/mL and PhiX174 at 1-2 PFU/mL. While the DNA workflow only detected PhiX174, the RNA workflow detected both MS2 and PhiX174. The virus concentration, or relative abundance of viral nucleic acids in total nucleic acids, is critical to the proportion of viral reads in sequencing results. Our findings also highlight the importance of including control samples in sequencing runs for environmental water samples with low virus abundance.

Predicting the consequences of manipulating genotype (G) and agronomic management (M) on agricultural ecosystem performances under future environmental (E) conditions remains a challenge. Crop modelling has the potential to enable society to assess the efficacy of G x M technologies to mitigate and adapt crop production systems to climate change. Despite recent achievements, dedicated research to develop and improve modelling capabilities from gene to global scales is needed to provide guidance on designing G x M adaptation strategies with full consideration of their impacts on both crop productivity and ecosystem sustainability under varying climatic conditions. Opportunities to advance the multiscale crop modelling framework include representing crop genetic traits, interfacing crop models with large-scale models, improving the representation of physiological responses to climate change and management practices, closing data gaps and harnessing multisource data to improve model predictability and enable identification of emergent relationships. A fundamental challenge in multiscale prediction is the balance between process details required to assess the intervention and predictability of the system at the scales feasible to measure the impact. An advanced multiscale crop modelling framework will enable a gene-to-farm design of resilient and sustainable crop production systems under a changing climate at regional-to-global scales.

We identify no gender differences in winning episodes, responding, or responding correctly to clues. Male teenagers (but not children) wager substantially more than female teenagers, leading to the emergence of the gender gap, equivalent to a 7.3 percentage point difference. This gap persists for college students. Finally, male teenagers and college students wager substantially less when competing against females, whereas the gender of opponents does not influence the behavior of young female contestants.

Zublin AG, Direktion Bauwerkserhaltung. In addition to an extensive concrete repair of the underground garage construction, the structural work for a previously non-existent elevator system had to be carried out. In the course of excavation work for the basic structure of the building, historical masonry remains were found in the ground. It turned out that the finds were remnants of the old city wall of Bonn. In the following, the fragments of the city wall had to be integrated into the basic structure of the new elevator system and made visible to the public. This resulted in numerous planning and constructional changes, which were successfully implemented in the course of the construction project.

Road Data Enrichment Framework Based on Heterogeneous Data Fusion for ITS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						ITS; heterogeneous data fusion; data enrichment; LBSM; incident detection; VANETs	INCIDENT DETECTION; TWITTER; EVENTS	In this work, we propose the Road Data Enrichment (RoDE), a framework that fuses data from heterogeneous data sources to enhance Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) services, such as vehicle routing and traffic event detection. We describe RoDE through two services: (i) Route service, and (ii) Event service. For the first service, we present the Twitter MAPS (T-MAPS), a low-cost spatiotemporal model to improve the description of traffic conditions through Location-Based Social Media (LBSM) data. As a case study, we explain how T-MAPS is able to enhance routing and trajectory descriptions by using tweets. Our experiments compare T-MAPS' routes against Google Maps' routes, showing up to 62% of route similarity, even though T-MAPS uses fewer and coarse-grained data. We then propose three applications, Route Sentiment (RS), Route Information (RI), and Area Tags (AT), to enrich T-MAPS' suggested routes. For the second service, we present the Twitter Incident (T-Incident), a low-cost learning-based road incident detection and enrichment approach built using heterogeneous data fusion. Our approach uses a learning-based model to identify patterns on social media data which is then used to describe a class of events, aiming to detect different types of events. Our model to detect events achieved scores above 90%, thus allowing incident detection and description as a RoDE application. As a result, the enriched event description allows ITS to better understand the LBSM user's viewpoint about traffic events (e.g., jams) and points of interest (e.g., restaurants, theaters, stadiums).

Ordinary least squares mistakenly reaches the opposite conclusion. The decline is driven by individuals not working prior to incarceration; these individuals increase participation in employment programs and raise their future employment and earnings. Previously employed individuals experience lasting negative employment effects. These findings demonstrate that time spent in prison with a focus on rehabilitation can be preventive for a large segment of the criminal population.

We show that credit constraints may affect investment even when workers do not exhaust their credit. Firms may invest in their workers' skills even when there are many similar competitors. Firm and worker incentives can lead to overinvestment. Optimal skill accumulation resembles-but is not-learning by doing. An example shows that shocks to skill productivity benefiting new workers but lowering one skill's value may adversely affect even relatively young workers, and adjustment may be discontinuous in age.

J	Kuehne, H; Richard, A; Gall, J				Kuehne, Hilde; Richard, Alexander; Gall, Juergen			A Hybrid RNN-HMM Approach for Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Segmentation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Videos; Hidden Markov models; Task analysis; Training; Supervised learning; Training data; Computational modeling; Weakly supervised learning; temporal action segmentation; temporal action alignment; action recognition	SEMI-MARKOV MODEL; ACTION RECOGNITION; STATE DURATION	Action recognition has become a rapidly developing research field within the last decade. But with the increasing demand for large scale data, the need of hand annotated data for the training becomes more and more impractical. One way to avoid frame-based human annotation is the use of action order information to learn the respective action classes. In this context, we propose a hierarchical approach to address the problem of weakly supervised learning of human actions from ordered action labels by structuring recognition in a coarse-to-fine manner. Given a set of videos and an ordered list of the occurring actions, the task is to infer start and end frames of the related action classes within the video and to train the respective action classifiers without any need for hand labeled frame boundaries. We address this problem by combining a framewise RNN model with a coarse probabilistic inference. This combination allows for the temporal alignment of long sequences and thus, for an iterative training of both elements. While this system alone already generates good results, we show that the performance can be further improved by approximating the number of subactions to the characteristics of the different action classes as well as by the introduction of a regularizing length prior. The proposed system is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, the Breakfast and the Hollywood extended dataset, showing a competitive performance on various weak learning tasks such as temporal action segmentation and action alignment.

In this article, we present our novel approach to humanoid navigation through cluttered environments, which exploits knowledge about different obstacle classes to decide how to deal with obstacles and select appropriate robot actions. To classify objects from RGB images and decide whether an obstacle can be overcome by the robot with a corresponding action, e.g., by pushing or carrying it aside or stepping over or onto it, we train and exploit a convolutional neural network (CNN). Based on associated action costs, we compute a cost grid containing newly observed objects in addition to static obstacles on which a 2D path can be efficiently planned. This path encodes the necessary actions that need to be carried out by the robot to reach the goal. We implemented our framework in the Robot Operating System (ROS) and tested it in various scenarios with a Nao robot as well as in simulation with the REEM-C robot. As the experiments demonstrate, using our CNN, the robot can robustly classify the observed obstacles into the different classes and decide on suitable actions to find efficient solution paths. Our system finds paths also through regions where traditional motion planning methods are not able to calculate a solution or require substantially more time.

Discovery of a new supernova remnant G21.8-3.0	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: observational; ISM: supernova remnants; radio continuum: general	GALACTIC PLANE; RADIO-CONTINUUM; IDENTIFICATION; EMISSION; CATALOG	Sensitive radio continuum surveys of the Galactic plane are ideal for discovering new supernova remnants (SNRs). From the Sino-German lambda 6-cm polarization survey of the Galactic plane, an extended shell-like structure has been found at l = 21 degrees.8, b = -3 degrees.0, which has a size of about 1 degrees. New observations were made with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope at lambda 11 cm to estimate the source spectrum, together with Urumqi lambda 6-cm and Effelsberg lambda 21-cm data. The spectral index of G21.8-3.0 was found to be alpha = -0.72 +/- 0.16. Polarized emission was mostly detected in the eastern half of G21.8-3.0 at both lambda 6 and lambda 11 cm. These properties, together with the Ha filament along its northern periphery and the lack of infrared emission, indicate that the emission is non-thermal, as is usual in shell-type SNRs.	[Gao, X.

We performed 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of a relativistic electron-proton jet of relatively large radius that carries a helical magnetic field. We focused our investigation on the interaction between the jet and the ambient plasma and explore how the helical magnetic field affects the excitation of kinetic instabilities such as the Weibel instability (WI), the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (kKHI), and the mushroom instability (MI). In our simulations these kinetic instabilities are indeed excited, and particles are accelerated. At the linear stage we observe recollimation shocks near the centre of the jet. As the electron-proton jet evolves into the deep non-linear stage, the helical magnetic field becomes untangled due to reconnection-like phenomena, and electrons are repeatedly accelerated as they encounter magnetic-reconnection events in the turbulent magnetic field.

Progress has been hampered by a lack of robust empirical constraints on the giant molecular cloud (GMC) lifecycle. We address this problem by systematically applying a new statistical method for measuring the evolutionary timeline of the GMC lifecycle, star formation, and feedback to a sample of nine nearby disc galaxies, observed as part of the PHANGS-AINIA survey. We measure the spatially resolved (similar to 100 pc) CO-to-H alpha flux ratio and find a universal de-correlation between molecular gas and young stars on GMC scales, allowing us to quantify the underlying evolutionary timeline. GMC lifetimes are short, typically 10-30 Myr, and exhibit environmental variation, between and within galaxies. At kpc-scale molecular gas surface densities Sigma(H2) >= 8 M-circle dot pc(-2), the GMC lifetime correlates with timescales for galactic dynamical processes, whereas at Sigma(H2) >= 8 M-circle dot pc(-2) GMCs decouple from galactic dynamics and live for an internal dynamical time-scale. After a long inert phase without massive star formation traced by H alpha (75-90 per cent of the cloud lifetime), GMCs disperse within just 1-5 Myr once massive stars emerge. The dispersal is most likely due to early stellar feedback, causing GMCs to achieve integrated star formation efficiencies of 4-10 per cent. These results show that galactic star formation is governed by cloud-scale, environmentally dependent, dynamical processes driving rapid evolutionary cycling. GMCs and H II regions are the fundamental units undergoing these lifecycles, with mean separations of 100-300 pc in star-forming discs. Future work should characterize the multiscale physics and mass flows driving these lifecycles.	[Chevance, Melanie; Kruijssen, J. M. Diederik; Hygate, Alexander P. S.; Jeffreson, Sarah M.

The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT - I. Science objectives and first results	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						instrumentation: interferometers; pulsars: general	X-RAY; ROTATION MEASURES; EMPIRICAL-THEORY; SPIN FREQUENCY; RADIO; EMISSION; EVOLUTION; BINARY; POLARIZATION; ALIGNMENT	We report here on initial results from the Thousand-Pulsar-Array (TPA) programme, part of the Large Survey Project 'MeerTime' on the MeerKAT telescope. The interferometer is used in the tied-array mode in the band from 856 to 1712 MHz, and the wide band coupled with the large collecting area and low receiver temperature make it an excellent telescope for the study of radio pulsars. The TPA is a 5 year project, which aims at to observing (a) more than 1000 pulsars to obtain high-fidelity pulse profiles, (b) some 500 of these pulsars over multiple epochs, and (c) long sequences of single-pulse trains from several hundred pulsars. The scientific outcomes from the programme will include the determination of pulsar geometries, the location of the radio emission within the pulsarmagnetosphere, the connection between the magnetosphere and the crust and core of the star, tighter constraints on the nature of the radio emission itself, as well as interstellar medium studies. First, results presented here include updated dispersion measures, 26 pulsars with Faraday rotation measures derived for the first time, and a description of interesting emission phenomena observed thus far.

A simulated global GM estimate of the asteroid 469219 Kamo'oalewa for China's future asteroid mission	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitation; methods: numerical; celestial mechanics; ephemerides; planets and satellites: fundamental parameters	GRAVITY-FIELD; MASS; FLYBY	Chinawill launch in the forthcoming years a sample return mission called ZhengHe, to asteroid 469219 Kamo'oalewa (provisional designation 2016HO3) and comet 133P/Elst-Pizarro. The mission will consist of an orbiter and a nano-lander. One of ZhengHe's investigations is the radio science experiment, whose main objective is the asteroid GM estimate. In this paper, we conduct full numerical simulations of the radio science experiment using the wudogs software package, developed by Wuhan University. In addition to two-way Doppler measurements, we also include one-way on-board distance measurements. A list of parameters including the spacecraft initial conditions and the global asteroid GM are solved using a weighted least-squares fit. The simulation results indicate that the GM solution is very sensitive to the ephemeris error. We need an accuracy within 2 km on the ephemeris of the asteroid to achieve a reliable estimate of GM.

Radio morphology-accretion mode link in Fanaroff-Riley type II low-excitation radio galaxies	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						catalogues; galaxies: active; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; MOLONGLO-SOUTHERN-4-JY SAMPLE MS4; ADVECTION-DOMINATED ACCRETION; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; JET POWER; STATISTICAL-METHODS; ASTRONOMICAL DATA; BEPPOSAX VIEW; UPPER LIMITS; CHANDRA	Fanaroff-Riley type II (FR II) low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) are characterized by weak nuclear excitation on parsec-scales and properties typical of powerful FR IIs (defined as high-excitation radio galaxies, hereafter HERGs/BLRGs) on kiloparsec-scales. Since a link between the accretion properties and the power of the produced jets is expected both from theory and observations, their nature is still debated. In this work, we investigate the X-ray properties of a complete sample of 19 FR II-LERGs belonging to the 3CR catalogue, exploiting Chandra andXMM-Newton archival data. We also analyse 32 FRII-HERGs/BLRGs with Chandra data as a control sample. We compared FR II-LERG and FR II-HERG/BLRG X-ray properties and optical data available in literature to obtain a wide outlook of their behaviour. The low accretion rate estimates for FR II-LERGs, from both X-ray and optical bands, allow us to firmly reject the hypothesis as they are the highly obscured counterpart of powerful FR II-HERGs/BLRGs. Therefore, at least two hypothesis can be invoked to explain the FR II-LERG nature: (i) they are evolving from classical FR IIs because of the depletion of accreting cold gas in the nuclear region, while the extended radio emission is the heritage of a past efficiently accreting activity; and (ii) they are an intrinsically distinct class of objects with respect to classical FR Is/FR IIs. Surprisingly, in this direction, a correlation between accretion rates and environmental richness is found in our sample. The richer the environment is, the more inefficient is the accretion. In this framework, the FR II-LERGs are intermediate between FR Is and FR II-HERGs/BLRGs both in terms of accretion rate and environment.

Analogous increase in the inhibitory activity in correlation with the peptide length reduction was not observed in case of other serine proteases, bovine trypsin (K-i = 151 nM for peptide 6 and K-i = 120 nM for HV-BBI) and plasmin (K-i = 120 nM for peptide 6 and 82 nM for HV-BBI). Weaker binding affinity to these enzymes emphasized an inhibitory specificity of peptide 6. Molecular dynamic analysis revealed that the observed variations in the binding affinity of peptide 6 and HV-BBI with matriptase-1 are associated with the entropic differences of the unbound peptides. Moreover, several aspects explaining differences in the inhibition of matriptase-1 by peptide 6 (bearing the C-terminal amide group) and its two analogues, peptide 6* (having the C-terminal carboxyl group, K-i = 473 nM) and cyclic peptide 6** (K-i = 533 nM), both exhibiting more than 50-fold reduced inhibitory potency, were discovered. It was also shown that peptide 6 presented significantly higher resistance to proteolytic degradation in human serum than HV-BBI. Additional investigations revealed that, in contrast to some amphibian-derived inhibitors, HV-BBI and its truncated analogues do not possess bactericidal activity, thus they cannot be considered as bifunctional agents.

One of the lines that probe emitting regions closest to the star is the Br gamma line. We consider different types of hybrid models to reproduce both interferometric VLTI-AMBER observations and LBT-LUCIFER spectroscopic observations of the single-peak profile of the Br gamma line of the Herbig AeBe star (HAEBE) VV Ser, a member of the UX Ori type subclass. We computed models of a magneto-centrifugal disk wind, a magnetospheric accretion region (magnetosphere), Cranmer's polar wind, and scattered light from circumstellar polar dust. Furthermore, we calculated hybrid two-component models consisting of a disk wind and one of the aforementioned models. We computed visibilities and line profiles for all types of models and compared them with the available interferometric observations to constrain model parameters. We conclude that for the inclinations reported for this star (60 degrees-70 degrees), the disk wind alone cannot explain the Br line profile although it may be a dominant contributor to the hydrogen line radiation. However, magneto-centrifugal disk wind in combination with aforementioned emitting regions (magnetosphere, polar wind, or scattered light from polar dust) may be able to reproduce the observations.

In the present paper, we study the effect of global terror intensity on the life satisfaction of Western citizens. We leverage panel datasets for six countries that we combine with daily information on all the terror attacks in the world over 20 years. Terror diminishes individual subjective well-being globally and continually. Using high frequency data over the long-run also allows us to provide a rich heterogeneity analysis on the relevant dimensions of terror. The effect is particularly strong for events broadcasted on Western television, when respondents are physically or genetically close to the victims, or for individuals who feel more exposed (e.g. living in urban areas). For a subset of countries, we also study the impact of terror on political attitudes and find that global terror significantly increases the intention to vote for conservative parties.

In the past, Ca(v)1.3 L-type VGCCs gathered most attention as their ablation causes congenital deafness. However, isolated patch-clamp investigation and localization studies repetitively suggested that Ca(v)2.3 R-type VGCCs are also expressed in the cochlea and further components of the ascending auditory tract, pointing to a potential functional role of Ca(v)2.3 in hearing physiology. Thus, we performed auditory profiling of Ca(v)2.3(+/+) controls, heterozygous Ca(v)2.3(+/-) mice and Ca(v)2.3 null mutants (Ca(v)2.3(-/-)) using brainstem-evoked response audiometry. Interestingly, click-evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) revealed increased hearing thresholds in Ca(v)2.3(+/-) mice from both genders, whereas no alterations were observed in Ca(v)2.3(-/-) mice. Similar observations were made for tone burst-related ABRs in both genders. However, Ca(v)2.3 ablation seemed to prevent mutant mice from total hearing loss particularly in the higher frequency range (36-42 kHz). Amplitude growth function analysis revealed, i.a., significant reduction in ABR wave W-I and W-III amplitude in mutant animals. In addition, alterations in W-I-W-IV interwave interval were observed in female Ca(v)2.3(+/-) mice whereas absolute latencies remained unchanged. In summary, our results demonstrate that Ca(v)2.3 VGCCs are mandatory for physiological auditory information processing in the ascending auditory tract.

Association of DNA repair gene polymorphisms with colorectal cancer risk and treatment outcomes	EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY			English	Review						Colorectal cancer; DNA repair; Polymorphism; Chemotherapy	SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; III COLON-CANCER; MOLECULAR PATHOLOGICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY; LIFE-STYLE FACTORS; OXALIPLATIN-BASED CHEMOTHERAPY; CELL LUNG-CANCER; MISMATCH REPAIR; MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; COMBINATION CHEMOTHERAPY	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common carcinoma worldwide. Despite the progress in screening and treatment, CRC remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Alterations to normal nucleic acid processing may drive neoplastic transformation of colorectal epithelium. DNA repair machinery performs an essential function in the protection of genome by reducing the number of genetic polymorphisms/variations that may drive carcinogenicity. Four essential DNA repair systems are known which include nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR), and double-strand break repair (DSBR). Polymorphisms of DNA repair genes have been shown to influence the risk of cancer development as well as outcomes of treatment. Several studies demonstrated the association between genetic polymorphism of DNA repair genes and increased risk of CRC in different populations. In this review, we have summarized the impact of DNA repair gene polymorphisms on risk of CRC development and treatment outcomes. Advancements of the current understanding for the impact of DNA repair gene polymorphisms on the risk and treatment of CRC may support diagnostic and predictive roles in patients with CRC.

Aortic stiffness, epicardial fat volume (EFV), left ventricular (LV) strain and fibrosis were evaluated within a single CMR examination and results were related to the presence of hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods: 20 healthy controls (57.2 +/- 8.2 years(y); 26.2 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2)), 31 hypertensive patients without DM (59.6 +/- 6.7 y; 28.4 +/- 4.7 kg/m(2)) and 12 hypertensive patients with DM (58.8 +/- 9.9y; 30.7 +/- 6.3 kg/m(2)) were examined at 1.5Tesla. Aortic stiffness was evaluated by calculation of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), EFV by a 3D-Dixon sequence. Longitudinal & circumferential systolic myocardial strain (LS; CS) were analyzed and T1-relaxation times (T1) were determined to detect myocardial fibrosis. Results: EFV was highest in hypertensive patients with diabetes (78.4 +/- 28.0 ml/m(2)) followed by only hypertensive patients (64.2 +/- 27.3 ml/m(2)) and lowest in controls (50.3 +/- 22.7 ml/m(2); p < 0.05). PWV was higher in hypertensive patients with diabetes (9.8 +/- 3.3 m/s) compared to only hypertensive patients (8.6 +/- 1.7 m/s; p < 0.05) and to controls (8.1 +/- 1.9 m/s; p < 0.05). LS&CS were worse in hypertensive patients with diabetes (LS:-20.9 +/- 5.1% and CS: -24.4 +/- 5.7%) compared to both only hypertensive patients (LS: -24.7 +/- 4.6%; CS: -27.1 +/- 5.0%; p < 0.05) and to controls (LS: -25.5 +/- 3.8; CS: -28.3 +/- 4.1%; p < 0.05). Both hypertensive groups with and without DM had higher Tis (994.0 +/- 43.2 ms; 991.6 +/- 35.5 ms) than controls (964.6 +/- 40.3 ms; p < 0.05). Conclusion: CMR revealed increased aortic stiffness and EFV in hypertensive patients, which were even higher in the presence of DM. Also signs of LV myocardial fibrosis and a reduced strain were revealed. These parameters support the assessment of CV risk and prognosis. They can accurately be measured with CMR within a single examination when normally different techniques are needed. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methods and results: Among 341 consecutive ACS patients, the clinical outcomes after ACS included composite cardiovascular events within the 2-year follow-up period. A significantly higher probability of primary outcomes was observed in HP positive patients than in HP negative patients. There were no significant differences in the rate of cardiovascular events between HP positive and HP negative patients in the absence of an IL-polymorphism, while there were significant differences in the presence of an IL-polymorphism. There were significant differences in the rate of cardiovascular events among CagA positive, CagA negative/ HP positive and CagA negative/HP negative patients. Moreover, via immunohistochemical staining, aortic CagA positive cells were confirmed in the vasa vasorum in CagA positive patients, whereas they could not be identified in CagA negative patients. Conclusions: The bacterial virulence factor CagA and host genetic IL-1 polymorphisms influence the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events, possibly through infection of atherosclerotic lesions.

Rare genetic variants in interleukin-37 link this anti-inflammatory cytokine to the pathogenesis and treatment of gout	ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES			English	Article						gout; gene polymorphism; cytokines; treatment; inflammation	INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES; DISEASE; IL-37; COMORBIDITIES; PREVALENCE; INHIBITOR; MUTATIONS; ARTHRITIS; BURDEN	Objective Gout is characterised by severe interleukin (IL)-1-mediated joint inflammation induced by monosodium urate crystals. Since IL-37 is a pivotal anti-inflammatory cytokine suppressing the activity of IL-1, we conducted genetic and functional studies aimed at elucidating the role of IL-37 in the pathogenesis and treatment of gout. Methods Variant identification was performed by DNA sequencing of all coding bases of IL37 using molecular inversion probe-based resequencing (discovery cohort: gout n=675, controls n=520) and TaqMan genotyping (validation cohort: gout n=2202, controls n=2295). Predictive modelling of the effects of rare variants on protein structure was followed by in vitro experiments evaluating the impact on protein function. Treatment with recombinant IL-37 was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model of gout. Results We identified four rare variants in IL37 in six of the discovery gout patients; p.(A144P), p.(G174Dfs*16), p.(C181*) and p.(N182S), whereas none emerged in healthy controls (Fisher's exact p-value=0.043). All variants clustered in the functional domain of IL-37 in exon 5 (p-value=5.71x10(-5)). Predictive modelling and functional studies confirmed loss of anti-inflammatory functions and we substantiated the therapeutic potential of recombinant IL-37 in the treatment of gouty inflammation. Furthermore, the carrier status of p.(N182S)(rs752113534) was associated with increased risk (OR=1.81, p-value=0.031) of developing gout in hyperuricaemic individuals of Polynesian ancestry. Conclusion Here, we provide genetic as well as mechanistic evidence for the role of IL-37 in the pathogenesis of gout, and highlight the therapeutic potential of recombinant IL-37 for the treatment of gouty arthritis.

In this study, the first EU-scale Horizon Scanning (HS) focusing on marine alien species was performed, aiming to deliver a ranked list of species that should be of high priority for risk assessment (Article 5 of the EU IAS Regulation). Species absent from or with a limited distribution in EU marine waters were targeted. In total, 363 alien species were initially screened for HS by a panel of experts, including a broad range of taxonomic groups. Species were scored for their likelihood of arrival, establishment, spread, and impact in EU waters. A consensus workshop ranked 267 species, including a subset of 26 prioritized species. These species are considered to be mainly introduced by shipping (fouling and ballast water), via the Suez Canal, and aquaculture activities. The 26 priority species were also scrutinized in terms of feasibility of their management; 18 of them were suggested for performing risk assessments on the basis of the EU IAS Regulation. Since biological invasions are dynamic and connected with accelerated globalization and diversified human activities, we recommend HS to be repeated periodically to review the species already listed and assess new ones.

To do this, we combine arcsecond resolution CO data from PHANGS-ALMA with multiwavelength data that trace the atomic gas, stellar structure, and star formation rate (SFR) for 28 nearby star-forming galaxies. We find that P-turb correlates with-but almost always exceeds-the estimated P-DE on kiloparsec scales. This indicates that the molecular gas is overpressurized relative to the large-scale environment. We show that this overpressurization can be explained by the clumpy nature of molecular gas; a revised estimate of P-DE on cloud scales, which accounts for molecular gas self-gravity, external gravity, and ambient pressure, agrees well with the observed P-turb in galaxy disks. We also find that molecular gas with cloud-scale in our sample is more likely to be self-gravitating, whereas gas at lower pressure it appears more influenced by ambient pressure and/or external gravity. Furthermore, we show that the ratio between P-turb and the observed SFR surface density, is compatible with stellar feedback-driven momentum injection in most cases, while a subset of the regions may show evidence of turbulence driven by additional sources. The correlation between P-DE in galaxy disks is consistent with the expectation from self-regulated star formation models. Finally, we confirm the empirical correlation between molecular-to-atomic gas ratio and kpc-scale P-DE reported in previous works.

Genome organization in proximity to the BAP1 locus appears to play a pivotal role in a variety of cancers	CANCER SCIENCE			English	Article						cancer; evolution; monosomy 3; repetitive sequence; uveal melanoma	TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENE; CELL CARCINOMA; SHORT ARM; UVEAL; DELETIONS; MUTATION; BROWSER; BREAST; ROBO1	Cancer studies primarily focus on the characterization of the key driver genes and the underlying pathways. However, the contribution of other cancer-associated genes located in the genomic neighborhood of the driver genes could help to understand further aspects of cancer progression. Given the frequent involvement of chromosome 3 in multiple human cancers, in particular in the form of the prognostically highly relevant monosomy 3 in uveal melanoma (UM), we investigated the cumulative impact of cancer-associated genes on chromosome 3. Our analysis showed that these genes are enriched with repetitive elements with genes surrounded by distinctive repeats (MIR, hAT-Charlie, ERVL-MaLR, LINE-2, and simple/low complexity) in the promoter being more precisely associated with cancer-related pathways than the ones with major transposable elements (SINE/Alu and LINE-1). Additionally, these genes showed strong intrachromosomal chromatin interactions in 3D nuclear organization. Further investigations revealed a genomic hotspot in the vicinity of BAP1 locus, which is affected in 27 types of different cancers and contains abundant noncoding RNAs that are often expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The cross-species comparison of these cancer-associated genes revealed mostly a shared synteny in closer primates. However, near to the BAP1 locus signs of chromosomal inversions were observed during the course of evolution. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the entire genomic neighborhood of cancer-associated genes located on any single chromosome. Based on our results, we hypothesize that monosomy of chromosome 3 will have important clinical and molecular consequences in the respective diseases and in particular in UM.

J	Bai, SB; Lu, P; Thiebes, B				Bai, Shibiao; Lu, Ping; Thiebes, Benni			Comparing characteristics of rainfall- and earthquake-triggered landslides in the Upper Minjiang catchment, China	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Landslides; Rainfall; Earthquake; Upper Minjiang catchment	2008 WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PATTERNS; BEICHUAN	The Upper Minjiang catchment is located at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau and is frequently affected by landslides. The two main triggering factors in the region are rainfall and high magnitude seismic shocks, such as the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. In this paper, we present a comparison study of pre-conditioning factors that drive the spatial occurrence of landslides in this high elevation region. We used a multi-temporal landslide inventory that differentiates between rainfall and earthquake triggers based on the analyses of satellite imagery, aerial photos, and field investigations. Our investigation revealed that the strongest influences on landslides are lithology and topographic factors. The difference between these two triggering factors can also be observed with respect to the relative slope positions: rainfall-triggered landslides are more frequently found at lower slopes, while seismic-induced landslides are more evenly distributed on very steep slope sections. In particular, the steep and deeply incised river terraces in this region are prone to landslides due to their rapid formation. This study presents the first analysis that differentiates two main triggering factors in order to understand the influence of rainfall and earthquakes on landslide occurrences in this region. Our results can also aid in the sustainable management of performance-based slope engineering and landslide risk reduction by reporting the differences regarding the spatial distribution of rainfall- and seismic-triggered slope failures. Consequently, these results can be used by local and regional decision-makers for risk management and spatial planning.

As test organisms, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used. Results: While the 4-field test is a manual method and better reflects the process in practice, with the Wiperator, the wiping process is better controlled because it is an automated procedure. A comparison of the effects of both methods on the target log(10)-reduction of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa indicates a statistically significant difference between the two test methods (Mann-Whitney U-Test. S. aureus: 0 (U-min)<4 (U-crit); n(1)=8, n(2)=8, p=0.001; 2-sided. P. aeruginosa: 24 (U-min)<26 (U-crit); n(1)=11, n(2)=10, p=0.025, 2-sided). In addition, the results indicate that the wipe used has a major influence on the success of the disinfection process. Discussion: Both methods are suitable for efficacy studies of surface disinfectants, yet they differ in some aspects. Additionally our data indicate a statistically significant difference between the two test methods. Conclusion: Efficiency testing of surface disinfection is a complex process that depends on many different parameters. Since the 4-field test better reflects the practice, it makes sense to stick to this test procedure, taking into account that the EN 16615 was approved by CEN TC 216 in 2015 after method validation ring trials.

Their relationship with other species groups within the subgenus is assessed and their divergence times are estimated. We find that G. (P.) alebion is the first lineage to diverge within Pazala in the early Miocene (20 Ma) and that G. (P.) tamerlanus and G.

Methods: Treatment-naive, HIV-1-positive adults [screening plasma viral load >= 1000 copies/ml; CD4(+) cell count >50 cells/mu l) were randomized (1 : 1) to D/C/F/TAF (N = 362) or D/C plus emtricitabine/tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (F/TDF) (N = 363) over at least 48 weeks. After week 48, patients could continue on or switch to D/C/F/TAF in an open-label extension phase until week 96. Results: At week 96, D/C/F/TAF exposure was 626 patient-years (D/C/F/TAF arm) and 109 patient-years (control arm post switch), week 96 virologic suppression (viral load <50 copies/ml; FDA-Snapshot, from baseline) was 85.1% (308/362) (D/C/F/TAF) and 83.7% (304/363) (control). Week 96 virologic failure (viral load >= 50 copies/ml; FDA-Snapshot) was 5.5% (20/362) and 4.4% (16/363), respectively. No darunavir, primary protease inhibitor or tenofovir resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) were observed post baseline. In one patient in each arm, an M184I and/or V RAM was detected. Few adverse event-related discontinuations (3% D/C/F/TAF; <1% control post switch) and no deaths occurred on D/C/F/TAF. Improved renal and bone parameters were maintained in the D/C/F/TAF arm and observed in the control arm post switch. Increases in total-cholesterol/high-density-lipoprotein--cholesterol rtio at week 96 were +0.25 versus baseline (D/C/F/TAF) and +0.24 versus switch (control). Conclusion: At week 96, D/C/F/TAF resulted in high virologic response and low virologic failure rates, with no resistance development to darunavir or TAF/TDF. Bone, renal and lipid safety were consistent with known D/C/F/TAF component profiles. Control arm safety post switch was consistent with the D/C/F/TAF arm. AMBER week 96 results confirm the efficacy, high barrier to resistance and bone/renal safety benefits of D/C/F/TAF for treatment-naive patients.

To get an overview of their occurrence and characteristics, we investigated process water (n = 50) from delivery and unclean areas as well as wastewater (n = 32) from the in-house wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of two German poultry slaughterhouses (slaughterhouses S1 and S2). The samples were screened for ESKAPE bacteria (Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) and Escherichia coli. Their antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and the presence of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenemase, and mobilizable colistin resistance genes were determined. Selected ESKAPE bacteria were epidemiologically classified using different molecular typing techniques. At least one of the target species was detected in 87.5% (n = 28/32) of the wastewater samples and 86.0% (n = 43/50) of the process water samples. The vast majority of the recovered isolates (94.9%, n = 448/ 472) was represented by E. coli (39.4%), the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii (ACB) complex (32.4%), S. aureus (12.3%), and K. pneumoniae (10.8%), which were widely distributed in the delivery and unclean areas of the individual slaughterhouses, including their wastewater effluents. Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., and P. aeruginosa were less abundant and made up 5.1% of the isolates. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed that the recovered isolates exhibited diverse resistance phenotypes and beta-lactamase genes. In conclusion, wastewater effluents from the investigated poultry slaughterhouses exhibited clinically relevant bacteria (E. coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and species of the ACB and Enterobacter cloacae complexes) that contribute to the dissemination of clinically relevant resistances (i.e., bla(CTX-M) or bla(SHV) and mcr-1) in the environment. IMPORTANCE Bacteria from livestock may be opportunistic pathogens and carriers of clinically relevant resistance genes, as many antimicrobials are used in both veterinary and human medicine. They may be released into the environment from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are influenced by wastewater from slaughterhouses, thereby endangering public health. Moreover, process water that accumulates during the slaughtering of poultry is an important reservoir for livestock-associated multidrug-resistant bacteria and may serve as a vector of transmission to occupationally exposed slaughterhouse employees. Mitigation solutions aimed at the reduction of the bacterial discharge into the production water circuit as well as interventions against their further transmission and dissemination need to be elaborated. Furthermore, the efficacy of in-house WWTPs needs to be questioned. Reliable data on the occurrence and diversity of clinically relevant bacteria within the slaughtering production chain and in the WWTP effluents in Germany will help to assess their impact on public and environmental health.

To overcome such disadvantages, numerous seizure detection techniques involving signal processing and machine learning tools have been developed. However, there still remain the problems of automatic detection with high efficiency and accuracy in distinguishing normal, interictal and ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this study we propose a novel method for automatic identification of epileptic seizures in singe-channel EEG signals based upon time-scale decomposition (ITD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and neural networks. First, EEG signals are decomposed into a series of proper rotation components (PRCs) and a baseline signal by using the ITD method. The first two PRCs of the EEG signals are extracted, which contain most of the EEG signals' energy and are considered to be the predominant PRCs. Second, four levels DWT is employed to decompose the predominant PRCs into different frequency bands, in which third-order Daubechies (db3) wavelet function is selected for analysis. Third, phase space of the PRCs is reconstructed based on db3, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear EEG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in EEG system dynamics between normal, interictal and ictal EEG signals. Fourth, neural networks are then used to model, identify and classify EEG system dynamics between normal (healthy), interictal and ictal EEG signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on the University of Bonn's widely used and publicly available epilepsy dataset to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy for eleven cases is reported to be 98.15%. Compared with many state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic detection of seizure EEG signals in the clinical application.

This prospective study assessed the effect of switching from aflibercept to ranibizumab on anatomical and functional outcomes in patients with persistent/recurrent disease activity. Methods SAFARI (NCT02161575) was a 6-month, prospective, single-arm study conducted in the UK and Germany. Patients, meeting strict eligibility criteria for one of two subgroups (primary treatment failure or suboptimal treatment response), received 3 monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections (0.5 mg). Thereafter, ranibizumab was administered pro re nata at monthly visits. The primary endpoint was change from baseline (CfB) to day 90 in central subfield retinal thickness (CSRT). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and retinal morphology parameters were assessed. Results One hundred patients were enrolled (primary treatment failure, 1; suboptimal treatment response, 99). In the overall population, there was a significant CfB in median CSRT of -30.75 mu m (95% CI -59.50,-20.50; p<0.0001) to day 90. Improvements were also observed in other quantitative and qualitative optical coherence tomography parameters. In Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters assessed by category, 55% and 59% of patients gained 0->= 15 letters versus baseline at day 90 and day 180, respectively. However, mean improvements in BCVA (CfB) to each time point were small (<= 2 letters). No new safety signals were identified. Conclusion Switching from aflibercept to ranibizumab led to a significant improvement in CSRT, with similar to 60% experiencing stabilised/improved BCVA. Therefore, patients with nAMD who have shown a suboptimal response to aflibercept may benefit from switching to ranibizumab.

Methods Thirty patients with gastrointestinal cancer received 5FU 650 or 1000 mg/m(2)/day as 5-day continuous venous infusion (14 of whom also received cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/day). 5FU and 5-fluoro-5,6-dihydrouracil (5FUH2) plasma concentrations were described by a pharmacokinetic model using NONMEM. Absolute leukocyte counts were described by a semi-mechanistic myelosuppression model. Covariate relationships were evaluated to explain the possible sources of variability in 5FU pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Results Total clearance of 5FU correlated with body surface area (BSA). Population estimate for total clearance was 249 L/h. Clearances of 5FU and 5FUH2 fractionally changed by 77%/m(2) difference from the median BSA. 5FU central and peripheral volumes of distribution were 5.56 L and 28.5 L, respectively. Estimated 5FUH2 clearance and volume of distribution were 121 L/h and 96.7 L, respectively. Baseline leukocyte count of 6.86 x 10(9)/L, as well as mean leukocyte transit time of 281 h accounting for time delay between proliferating and circulating cells, was estimated. The relationship between 5FU plasma concentrations and absolute leukocyte count was found to be linear. A higher degree of myelosuppression was attributed to combination therapy (slope = 2.82 L/mg) with cisplatin as compared to 5FU monotherapy (slope = 1.17 L/mg). Conclusions BSA should be taken into account for predicting 5FU exposure. Myelosuppression was influenced by 5FU exposure and concomitant administration of cisplatin.

The Impact of Nocturia on Falls and Fractures: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Review						accidental falls; fractures, bone; meta-analysis; nocturia; systematic review	URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS; BODY-MASS INDEX; INCIDENT FALLS; RISK; ASSOCIATION; MEN; INJURIES; QUALITY; GRADE; BIAS	Purpose: Although nocturia is associated with various comorbidities, its impact on falls and fractures remains unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between nocturia and falls and fractures as a prognostic and as a causal risk factor. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed (R), Scopus (R), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) and abstracts of major urological meetings up to December 31, 2018. We conducted random effects meta-analyses of adjusted relative risks of falls and fractures. We applied the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the quality of evidence for nocturia as a prognostic and causal factor of falls and fractures. Results: Among 5,230 potential reports 9 observational longitudinal studies provided data on the association between nocturia and falls or fractures (1 for both, 4 for falls, 4 for fractures). Pooled estimates demonstrated a risk ratio of 1.20 (95% CI 1.05-1.37, I-2 = 51.7%, annual risk difference 7.5% among the elderly) for association between nocturia and falls and 1.32 (95% CI 0.99-1.76, I-2 = 57.5%, annual risk difference 1.2%) for association between nocturia and fractures. Subgroup analyses showed no significant effect modification by age, gender, followup time, nocturia case definition or risk of bias. We rated the quality of evidence for nocturia as a prognostic factor as moderate for falls and low for fractures, and as very low as a cause of falls/fractures. Conclusions: Nocturia is probably associated with an approximately 1.2-fold increased risk of falls and possibly an approximately 1.3-fold increased risk of fractures.

J	Keshavarzi, A; Haghighat, AT; Bohlouli, M				Keshavarzi, Amin; Haghighat, Abolfazl Toroghi; Bohlouli, Mahdi			Enhanced time-aware QoS prediction in multi-cloud: a hybrid k-medoids and lazy learning approach (QoPC)	COMPUTING			English	Article						Quality of Service; Multi-cloud; Lazy Learning; LB-Keogh		Cloud service providers should be able to predict the future states of their infrastructure in order to avoid any violation of Service Level Agreement. This becomes more complex when vendors have to deal with services from various providers in multi-clouds. As a result, QoS prediction can significantly support service providers in a better understanding of their resources future states. Users should also be very well aware of their resource needs, as well as the Quality of Service relative values. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to the prediction of the future value of the QoS features. The hybrid approach uses a modified version of k-medoids algorithm for the clustering of large time-series datasets, as well as a proposed algorithm inspired from the lazy learning and lower bound Dynamic Time Warping (LB-Keogh) for pruned DTW computations. The proposed method in this manuscript is a shape-based QoS prediction with a novel pre-processing method, which fulfills the missing data with statistically semi-real data. In order to solve the cold start problem, we proposed new algorithm based on the DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA) algorithm. The results showed that our predicted values are very close to real values and achieve only 0.35 of the normalized mean absolute error rate, on average, for the WSDream dataset and 0.07 for the Alibaba dataset.

In this review, we argue that computational models can be both relevant and useful in neurodegenerative disease research and although the current established models have limitations in clinical practice, artificial intelligence has the potential to overcome deficiencies encountered by these models, which in turn can improve our understanding of disease. Recent findings In recent years, diverse computational approaches have been used to shed light on different aspects of neurodegenerative disease models. For example, linear and nonlinear mixed models, self-modeling regression, differential equation models, and event-based models have been applied to provide a better understanding of disease progression patterns and biomarker trajectories. Additionally, the Cox-regression technique, Bayesian network models, and deep-learning-based approaches have been used to predict the probability of future incidence of disease, whereas nonnegative matrix factorization, nonhierarchical cluster analysis, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and deep-learning-based approaches have been employed to stratify patients based on their disease subtypes. Furthermore, the interpretation of neurodegenerative disease data is possible through knowledge-based models which use prior knowledge to complement data-driven analyses. These knowledge-based models can include pathway-centric approaches to establish pathways perturbed in a given condition, as well as disease-specific knowledge maps, which elucidate the mechanisms involved in a given disease. Collectively, these established models have revealed high granular details and insights into neurodegenerative disease models. In conjunction with increasingly advanced computational approaches, a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disease models, which can be broadly categorized into data-driven and knowledge-driven, have been developed. We review the state of the art data and knowledge-driven models and discuss the necessary steps which are vital to bring them into clinical application.

In pediatric patients, a genetic or metabolic disease has to be excluded, so that adequate treatment can be installed as early as possible. Only then either recurrent stone events and chronic or even end-stage kidney disease can be prevented. Recent findings The genetic background of mostly monogenic kidney stone diseases was unravelled recently. In hypercalcuria, for example, the commonly used definition of idiopathic hypercalciuria was adopted to the genetic background, here three autosomal recessive hereditary forms of CYP24A1, SLC34A1 and SLC34A3 associated nephrocalcinosis/urolithiasis with elevated 1.25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (1.25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3) (calcitriol) levels. In addition either activating or inactivating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor gene lead either to hypocalcemic hypercalciuria or hypercalcemic hypocalciuria. In primary hyperoxaluria, a third gene defect was unravelled explaining most of the so far unclassified patients. In addition, these findings lead to new treatment options, which are currently evaluated in phase III studies. Kidney stones are not the disease itself, but only its first symptom. The underlying disease has to be diagnosed in every pediatric patient with the first stone event.

An Old Method Revisited	EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & DIABETES			English	Review						Diabetes; hypoglycaemia; diabetic ketoacidosis; postmortem diagnosis; vitreous humor	CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; DIABETES-MELLITUS; HYPOGLYCEMIA; DEATH; INSULIN; CHEMISTRY; LACTATE; TYPE-1	It has been estimated that 15 % up to one third of cases of deaths due to diabetic ketoacidosis occur in individuals with so far unknown diabetes. Moreover, cardiac arrhythmias that occur during nocturnal hypoglycaemia include bradycardia and ectopics that may provoke lethal arrhythmias. As postmortem capillary glucose concentrations have no diagnosticvalue, the postmortem forensic proof of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia remains a challenge. The established but rarely applied method of postmortem determination of glucose and lactate in vitreous humor with or without calculation of the sum formula of Traub could provide reliable exclusion or proof of severe antemortem disorders in glucose metabolism. To date, diagnostic puncture of vitreous humor is more established for the postmortem detection of diabetic ketoacidosis than for the exclusion or proof of lethal hypoglycaemia. Vitreous humor is protected from postmortem degradation and contamination due to its isolated localization. The autolytic process in vitreous humor is considerably delayed compared to blood or liquor. In vitreous humor also the triggering agent of hypoglycaemia (insulin, insulin analogues) is easier to be detected than in blood since insulins are very unstable in postmortem blood. Furthermore, parameters of long term glycaemic control such as 1,5-anhydroglucitol, HbA1c and fructosamine can be determined in vitreous humor. However, limitations and interference factors of this method should be carefully considered. So far, clinical diabetology has taken no broad notice of this useful forensic procedure.

Many outstanding studies have given good results in the two-class seizure detection problems, but most of them are based on hand-wrought feature extraction. This study proposes an end-to-end automatic seizure detection system based on deep learning, which does not require heavy preprocessing on the EEG data or feature engineering. The fully convolutional network with three convolution blocks is first used to learn the expressive seizure characteristics from EEG data. Then these robust EEG features pertinent to seizures are presented as an input to the Nested Long Short-Term Memory (NLSTM) model to explore the inherent temporal dependencies in EEG signals. Lastly, the high-level features obtained from the NLSTM model are fed into the softmax layer to output predicted labels. The proposed method yields an accuracy range of 98.44-100% in 10 different experiments based on the Bonn University database. A larger EEG database is then used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in real-life situations. The average sensitivity of 97.47%, specificity of 96.17%, and false detection rate of 0.487 per hour are yielded. For CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database, the proposed model also achieves a segment-level sensitivity of 94.07% with a false detection rate of 0.66 per hour. The excellent results obtained on three different EEG databases demonstrate that the proposed method has good robustness and generalization power under ideal and real-life conditions.

Here, we sought to compare the spatial characteristics of mechanisms mediating hue perception against those mediating chromatic detection in individuals with known spectral topography and with optical aberrations removed with adaptive optics. Chromatic detection sensitivity in general exceeded previous measurements and decreased monotonically for increasingly skewed cone spectral compositions. The spatial grain of hue perception was significantly coarser than chromatic detection, consistent with separate neural mechanisms for col or vision operating at different spatial scales.

The aim of the present study is to assess the older emergency patient in regard to the core data set "Emergency Department" of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI). Materials and methods Monocentric, retrospective observational study. Results In the observation period, a total of 29,391 emergency patients were treated at the interdisciplinary emergency center. Of these, 8072 emergency patients were >= 65 years old (27.4%). With increasing age, paramedic ambulances (RTW) or physician-led ambulances (NEF) are increasingly used (p& x202f;< 0.001). Older emergency patients arriving by a physician-led emergency service show a 38.9-fold increase in mortality compared to ambulatory patients (odds ratio& x202f;= 38.98 [29.22-51.87]). The initial assessment, using the Manchester Triage System (MTS), shows a steady rise towards higher urgency levels with increasing age (p& x202f;< 0.001). In the multivariate analysis within the individual age clusters, there is a correlation between the triage level and hospital mortality, unrelated to gender (p& x202f;< 0.001). Likewise the use of consulting physicians can be linked to advanced age (p& x202f;< 0.001). Also the length of stay in the interdisciplinary emergency center correlates highly with age (p& x202f;< 0.001). Conclusion The older emergency patient clearly differs from younger emergency patients in all key performance indicators considered and already poses a special challenge to emergency departments.

Additionally, in the interstellar medium, random and noncircular motions arise from stellar feedback, cloud-cloud interactions, and instabilities, among other processes. Our aim is to comprehend to what extent small-scale gas dynamics is decoupled from galactic rotation. We study the relative contributions of galactic rotation and local noncircular motions to the circulation of gas, Gamma, a macroscopic measure of local rotation, defined as the line integral of the velocity field around a closed path. We measure the circulation distribution as a function of spatial scale in a set of simulated disk galaxies and model the velocity field as the sum of galactic rotation and a Gaussian random field. The random field is parameterized by a broken power law in Fourier space, with a break at the scale at which galactic rotation and noncircular motions contribute equally to Gamma. For our simulated galaxies, the gas dynamics at the scale of molecular clouds is usually dominated by noncircular motions, but in the center of galactic disks galactic rotation is still relevant. Our model shows that the transfer of rotation from large scales breaks at the scale , and this transition is necessary to reproduce the circulation distribution. We find that, and therefore the structure of the gas velocity field, is set by the local conditions of gravitational stability and stellar feedback.

In the present study we tested both candidates in two models of chronic filarial infection, namely the Litomosoides sigmodontis and Brugia pahangi jird model and assessed their long-term effect on Wolbachia depletion, microfilariae counts and filarial embryogenesis 16 -18 weeks after treatment initiation (wpt). Once per day (QD) oral treatment with CBR417 (50 mg/kg) for 4 days or twice per day (BID) with CBR490 (25 mg/kg) for 7 days during patent L. sigmodontis infection reduced the Wolbachia load by > 99% and completely cleared peripheral microfilaremia from 10-14 wpt. Similarly, 7 days of QD treatments (40 mg/kg) with CBR417 or CBR490 cleared > 99% of Wolbachia from B. pahangi and reduced peritoneal microfilariae counts by 93% in the case of CBR417 treatment. Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated intensive damage to the B. pahangi ovaries following CBR417 treatment and in accordance filarial embryogenesis was inhibited in both models after CBR417 or CBR490 treatment. Suboptimal treatment regimens of CBR417 or CBR490 did not lead to a maintained reduction of the microfilariae and Wolbachia load. In conclusion, CBR417 or CBR490 are pre-clinical candidates for filarial diseases, which achieve long-term clearance of Wolbachia endosymbionts of filarial nematodes, inhibit filarial embryogenesis and clear microfilaremia with treatments as short as 7 days.

Objective: We examined whether a significant portion of unexplained AD heritability is further explained by low-frequency and rare variants in the gene-coding sequence. Methods: We evaluated common, low-frequency, and rare protein-coding variants using exome chip and replication genotype data of 15,574 patients and 377,839 control subjects combined with whole-transcriptome data on lesional, nonlesional, and healthy skin samples of 27 patients and 38 control subjects. Results: An additional 12.56% (SE, 0.74%) of AD heritability is explained by rare protein-coding variation. We identified docking protein 2 (DOK2) and CD200 receptor 1 (CD200R1) as novel genome-wide significant susceptibility genes. Rare coding variants associated with AD are further enriched in 5 genes (IL-4 receptor [IL4R], IL13, Janus kinase 1 [JAK1], JAK2, and tyrosine kinase 2 [TYK2]) of the IL13 pathway, all of which are targets for novel systemic AD therapeutics. Multiomics-based network and RNA sequencing analysis revealed DOK2 as a central hub interacting with, among others, CD200R1, IL6R, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Multitissue gene expression profile analysis for 53 tissue types from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project showed that disease-associated protein-coding variants exert their greatest effect in skin tissues. Conclusion: Our discoveries highlight a major role of rare coding variants in AD acting independently of common variants. Further extensive functional studies are required to detect all potential causal variants and to specify the contribution of the novel susceptibility genes DOK2 and CD200R1 to overall disease susceptibility.

Reports on surgical management and seizure outcome of epileptogenic CCM often focus on intracranial cavernoma in general. Therefore, data on CCMs within the temporal lobe are scarce. The authors therefore analyzed their institutional data. METHODS From 2003 to 2018, 52 patients suffering from CCMs located within the temporal lobe underwent surgery for CRE at University Hospital Bonn. Information on patient characteristics, preoperative seizure history, preoperative evaluation, surgical strategies, postoperative complications, and seizure outcome was assessed and further analyzed. Seizure outcome was assessed 12 months after surgery according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification and stratified into favorable (ILAE class I) versus unfavorable (ILAE classes II-VI). RESULTS Overall, 47 (90%) of 52 patients with CCMs located in the temporal lobe and CRE achieved favorable seizure outcome. Pure lesionectomy was performed in 5 patients, extended lesionectomy with resection of the hemosiderin rim in 38 patients, and anterior temporal lobectomy in 9 patients with temporal lobe CCM. Specifically, 36 patients (69%) suffered from drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), 3 patients (6%) from chronic CRE, and 13 patients (25%) sustained sporadic CRE. In patients with DRE, favorable seizure outcome was achieved in 32 (89%) of 36 patients. Patients with DRE were significantly older than patients with CCM-associated chronic or sporadic seizures (p = 0.02). Furthermore, patients with DRE more often underwent additional amygdalohippocampectomy following the recommendation of presurgical epileptological evaluation. CONCLUSIONS Favorable seizure outcome is achievable in a substantial number of patients with epileptogenic CCM located in the temporal lobe, even if patients suffered from drug-resistant CRE. For adequate counseling and monitoring, patients with CRE should undergo a thorough pre- and postsurgical evaluation in dedicated epilepsy surgery programs.

II. The Bottleneck to Collapse Set by Cloud-Environment Decoupling	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Galaxies; Star formation; Interstellar medium	FORMATION RATES; COLUMN DENSITY; UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE; FORMATION EFFICIENCY; VELOCITY DISPERSION; DYNAMICAL MODEL; NEARBY GALAXIES; DEPLETION TIME; MILKY-WAY; TURBULENCE	In Meidt et al., we showed that gas kinematics on the scale of individual molecular clouds are not entirely dominated by self-gravity but also track a component that originates with orbital motion in the potential of the host galaxy. This agrees with observed cloud line widths, which show systematic variations from virial motions with environment, pointing at the influence of the galaxy potential. In this paper, we hypothesize that these motions act to slow down the collapse of gas and so help regulate star formation. Extending the results of Meidt et al., we derive a dynamical collapse timescale that approaches the free-fall time only once the gas has fully decoupled from the galactic potential. Using this timescale, we make predictions for how the fraction of free-falling, strongly self-gravitating gas varies throughout the disks of star-forming galaxies. We also use this collapse timescale to predict variations in the molecular gas star formation efficiency, which is lowered from a maximum, feedback-regulated level in the presence of strong coupling to the galactic potential. Our model implies that gas can only decouple from the galaxy to collapse and efficiently form stars deep within clouds. We show that this naturally explains the observed drop in star formation rate per unit gas mass in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone and other galaxy centers. The model for a galactic bottleneck to star formation also agrees well with resolved observations of dense gas and star formation in galaxy disks and the properties of local clouds.

About two decades later, sensitive observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) revealed the presence of a spatially coincident millijansky double source that appeared to be its radio counterpart. However, over the years it has been concluded that the radio source shows large proper motions to the south while the infrared source n is stationary. Here we reanalyze the proper motions of the radio source adding both older and newer VLA observations than previously used. We confirm the proper motions of the double radio source that at present no longer coincides positionally with the infrared source. We propose that the infrared source is stationary while the radio source is moving as a result of the explosion that took place in this region some 500 yr ago. Considering the paper where it was first reported, we refer to this double radio source as Orion MR. Additionally, we use these new observations to fully confirm the large proper motions of the sources IRc23 and Zapata 11. Together with sources BN, I, Orion MR, and x, there are at least six compact sources that recede from a common point in Orion BN/KL. However, IRc23 is peculiar in that its ejection age appears to be only 300 yr. The relatively large number of sources rules out as a possible mechanism the classic three-body scenario since then only two escaping bodies are expected: a tight binary plus the third star involved in the encounter.

Charlton			A post glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment to proteins, type 2 (PGAP2) variant identified in Mabry syndrome index cases: Molecular genetics of the prototypical inherited GPI disorder	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article						Mabry syndrome; Inherited glycosylphosphatidylinositol deficiency (IGD); Post GPI attachment to proteins; Type 2 (PGAP2); Isoform 8; Whole exome/genome sequencing	ANCHOR-SYNTHESIS PATHWAY; MENTAL-RETARDATION; NEUROLOGIC DEFICIT; CAUSE HYPERPHOSPHATASIA; DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; MUTATIONS; SEIZURES; BIOSYNTHESIS; PHENOTYPE; EPILEPSY	We report that recessive inheritance of a post-GPI attachment to proteins 2 (PGAP2) gene variant results in the hyperphosphatasia with neurologic deficit (HPMRS) phenotype described by Mabry et al., in 1970. HPMRS, or Mabry syndrome, is now known to be one of 21 inherited glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) deficiencies (IGDs), or GPI biosynthesis defects (GPIBDs). Bi-allelic mutations in at least six genes result in HPMRS phenotypes. Disruption of four phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG) biosynthesis genes, PIGV, PIGO, PIGW and PIGY, expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum, result in HPMRS 1, 2, 5 and 6; disruption of the PGAP2 and PGAP3 genes, necessary for stabilizing the association of GPI anchored proteins (AP) with the Golgi membrane, result in HPMRS 3 and 4. We used exome sequencing to identify a novel homozygous missense PGAP2 variant NM_014489.3:c.881C > T, p.Thr294Met in two index patients and targeted sequencing to identify this variant in an unrelated patient. Rescue assays were conducted in two PGAP2 deficient cell lines, PGAP2 KO cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9 and PGAP2 deficient CHO cells, in order to examine the pathogenicity of the PGAP2 variant. First, we used the CHO rescue assay to establish that the wild type PGAP2 isoform 1, translated from transcript 1, is less active than the wild type PGAP2 isoform 8, translated from transcript 12 (alternatively spliced to omit exon 3). As a result, in our variant rescue assays, we used the more active NM_001256240.2:c.698C > T, p.Thr233Met isoform 8 instead of NM_014489.3:c.881C > T, p.Thr294Met isoform 1. Flow cytometric analysis showed that restoration of cell surface CD59 and CD55 with variant PGAP2 isoform 8, driven by the weak (pTA FLAG) promoter, was less efficient than wild type isoform 8. Therefore, we conclude that recessive inheritance of c.881C > T PGAP2, expressed as the hypomorphic PGAP2 c.698C > T, p.Thr233Met isoform 8, results in prototypical Mabry phenotype, HPMRS3 (GPIBD 8 [MIM: 614207]). This study highlights the need for long-term follow up of individuals with rare diseases in order to ensure that they benefit from innovations in diagnosis and treatment.
